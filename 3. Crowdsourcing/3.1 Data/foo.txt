<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, too) undoubtedly influenced people's votes when it
I'd go with <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
This is potentially useful for <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, PHP, JS and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
And your other server languages like <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, PHP, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, etc.
Java learned a lot from <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> and even C#.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>/Groovy/Perl is:
Java, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>, Perl, also all work.
highlighting mzscheme, perl, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> by default.
Highly skilled in Perl, PHP, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> programming languages.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, java, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, php, javascript
So it comes down to <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> Compiled languages - e.g.
However, there is <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> Rails to consider.
Perl, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>, and Unix shell scripts are also used.
Possibly <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Groovy, Perl, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>, Bash).
Speed: similar to Perl, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Drop it immediately and start learning PHP, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
language such as JavaScript, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>, Groovy, etc.).
PHP, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>?
I prefer <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> over <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> on windows.
Perl, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, PHP, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>), forking isn't a problem.
Perl, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> and C# are good ones.
I have a extrange problem compiling <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> extension.
Scripting- <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>, Perl, PowerShell.
While <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> is slightly faster, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> utilises memory better.
A <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> script might work better for this....
That's because a lot of those applications may not even be written in D or have anything to do with D, like the mass of stuff written in dynamic languages like perl, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, etc.
The script uses SQLite3 as a backend, because bash is not good with arrays, and because I'm not good with Perl/<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Immutability fits into this complex because in <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>/Perl/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>/other languages I often solve this with some form of monkeypatching, which is a form of mutability.
There are much better alternatives (<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>).
Your C# and VB devs can suddenly easily write web apps and your <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> devs can too - with the added bonus of much better performance.
Maybe we should stop using languages like <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> and Perl because they're "slow".
He raises the point that runtime libraries for <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> / <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> etc have a unique set of issues because they tend to have their own packaging systems.
But maybe that's just because I'm not used to seeing <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, just as you're not used to seeing <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> code.
I guess that's fair because the implementation might be done better in <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> than it was in <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I'm not totally convinced the debugging tools for Perl, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> or PHP are substantially better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, even if they are slightly better.
Agile development is the most popular model at the moment because of architectures like <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> on Rails and Django (for <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>).
In addition the comparison on multi-core machines is also flawed because <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> code uses only one CPU whereas <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> uses all four due to use of multiprocessing library.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> is even worse than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Perl, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> were successful because their creators were good coders with clear goals, who shipped useful programs.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> were much more recently the "hot new thing" and have gotten a lot more attention in the last decade or so because of that.
I've tried <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, and can see why people like it, but <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> suits my style better.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> are languages competing for a similar bracket, so they will always appear to be "converging," because smart people are finding the key features.
I started with OO languages (<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> & <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>) because people recommend them, and they seem to be relatively easy to get started with.
Unfortunately, when it comes to potential projects <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> suffers because it's similarity to <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
It is worth noting that because the APIs use the standard HTTP protocol you can easily work with them from any programming language including C#, Java, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>, Perl, PHP and others.
With dynamically typed languages, like PHP, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, your development will be much faster, but you will have to test your code much better.
The only reason <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> is used over <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, is because of libraries...
And now that MS has support for <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, they are as evil as before but also stupid, because that means they don't have any direction to give to the community.
a sequence reserve can be simply: s.reverse etc. if you use databases: <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> database binding API is arguably better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
It comes with an updated XML stack and lets dynamic languages like <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, Groovy, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> and JavaScript get better performance running on JVMs.
We will just be a little more conscious," because I don't see <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> as being inevitably slower.
The problem is <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> are not seen as enterprise ready or fit for anything better than simple applications.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> perform significantly better.
Yes, I keep on bitchin' on collectors because I should probably spend my free time learning <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> or something.
The even better news is that it is actually possible to use a variety of tools: <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, shell scripts and R to perform distributed fault tolerant processing of your data on a Hadoop cluster....
That hurts because for a company to want a telecommuter bad enough, they'd better bring some serious talent to the table which usually consists of front-end, backend, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> experience.
So in <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, a good programmer will want to take a different route to solving the problem than he would in <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, just because it actually is the better way to do it.
He also thinks that "SOAP never caught on because many popular languages were left out such as <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>."
I mention all that because I think you've missed an important way in which <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> blocks are more powerful than anything in <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>: a block executes fully within the defining context.
For better or worse, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>, JavaScript and so on have changed how people see programming.
People fight over principles like "<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> is better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>" or "you shouldn't write unit test," all of which are absolutely absurd.
Node is a good fit for CouchDB because Couch encourages asynchronous background processes, but people also use <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> / <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> / Java for the same purposes.
It is a lot easier to do text parsing in Perl/<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> than it is in Java or C# (partially because it is a lot easier to use regular expressions).
Wanting to learn more about Google Wave, I ported the Wave Robot <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> Client library to <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, mainly because I wanted to understand the protocol.
for json: i also think its better to just use <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, perl and transform it.
Sitting down with another programming language for a while can open your mind up to other ways of solving problems, and I think I became a better <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> programmer after spending time in <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> land.
I think this is very accurate because I see most people that complain against PHP, they are usually somebody that has an agenda to favor some other language... can be <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> is like perl and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>, only better, and it is required to run this software.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> are even worse than Java performance wise.
I wonder if they didn't compare themselves to <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> because they couldn't contrive examples that produce huge LOC differences?
For this reason alone, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> is clearly better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> or Perl.
Anyway, for this book, geany has been used, mainly because it handles both <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> (amongst many others), and is rather lightweight.
I love the language but I'm considering getting better at <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> just because <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> is so slow I feel bad using it for anything serious.
Modern languages like scala, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> and maybe <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> are much better at this.
I usually recommend <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> over <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, as I prefer it, but in this case it may be better, due to everything inherently being an object.
It's why I mention <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>, because they've at least heard of them.
And so you have many programmers choosing to use <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> because good libraries exist there for solving modern problems.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> may actually help promote better programming practices, but they aren't as accessible as PHP in terms of examples, online docs and tutorials, and hosting is not as easy.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> would have also been a good choice but IMO it is an inferior language compared to <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Got a good job writing C++? Hopefully you also know some Java, or better yet some <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> or some other higher level scripting language.
I'd been kind of hoping Apple would dump AppleScript and switch over to <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> or (even better) <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> as the official AppleEvent scripting language [1].
I'd go so far as to say <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> aren't either, though both are very powerful and are better suited to some tasks than Java.
Proves Superior to <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>, Perl and Other Dynamic Programming Languages
I'm a huge <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>/Django & <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>/Rails fan, but I will never stop using PHP because it is so broadly accepted and supported.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> support features of orthogonality, maintainability, etc. even better, in many respects.
Your argument of awk being the "underlanguage" and not suitable for the job because you think that only Perl/<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> can do the job is flawed and weak.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> has RDoc , and it looks better than anything I've seen in <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
You might be better served learning a language like Objective-C, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> or even Unix shell-scripting, which are more useful for creating useful code on modern computer systems.
Any sources that discuss the pros and cons of each or why it would be better to do X in <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> rather than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span>?
Perl isn't dying because the competition, namely <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, is itself idiosyncratic," Hyperlogos blogger Martin Espinoza opined.
Today? You'll build a better app in less time and with fewer people using <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> with Django or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> on Rails.
One of them ( Jan rather than Andrzej ) was of the opinion that <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> was more object oriented than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> because you are able tack methods onto the built-in classes.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, WordPress, and the old standard OpenOffice (in a freshly minted version 4) are better and stronger than ever.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_A]</span> has better support for such declarative styles and I am glad the core <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_B]</span> language is not going down that route.
Mainly because <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> is used in considerably more non-web applications than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>, which makes your skills more portable (and you more employable).
This is one area where MySQL Cookbook really shines, because it contains a large amount of sample code in Perl, PHP, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>, Java, and even <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I use <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span> heavily because it's easy for other people to understand and I can quickly do a task in them.
I take your word that Perl/<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">python:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">ruby:[OBJECT_B]</span>/LISP/whatever is much superior.

<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> / BlackBerry / <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> / Symbian
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> is much better, economically speaking, than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Probably because of this they would find <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> more simple and straightforward than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
If you're a fed-up <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> user looking to switch to an <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> device, there are better options.
I'm actually quite disappointed with how much better are the photos than from my <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span>, which easily matched <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> 4S.
why accept an inferior phone running Google's <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> when you can have Apple's superior <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> for a hundred dollars more?" That is a matter of opinion.
It multitasks even better than <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span>, its as responsive as an <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>, and its hardware is better than most blackberries.
People do not necessarily switch from an <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> to an <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> or vice versa because they think one is better than the other.
This is significant if you consider there are a number of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> phones available for a similar price which are technologically superior to the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> 3GS .
How hard is it to accept the fact <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> is doing better then the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> these days?
However, with Apple's switch, Google's superior mapping app gives <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> phones a clear advantage over the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> in this important function.
There was no port to <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span>, iPad, or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> because that would require rewriting the program.
(Seriously this page works worse on an <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> using chrome than it did on the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> using safari.)
Unsure if the ole <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> has this app, because <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> is so much better..lol..but the SLEEP APNEA 2.0 SLEEP ANALYZER works great.
See what <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> has to offer " better smartphones than BlackBerries!
must have been reading our site because they finally ported their popular <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> application to <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Yawn... <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> phones are rapidly becoming better spec'd out than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
These great apps will help you get better photos on your <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> smart phone.
From an end user perspective, the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> , <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> and even the Windows Phone are providing better functionality than the BlackBerry.
iHater muck-raking is useless because a 90% working <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> 4 is still better than a 95% working <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> or Symbian or RIM crapphone.
Make it a unique one a better one than <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
While we find this better in implementation that the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span>, it's still more limited than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
There is nothing the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> can do that an equally powerful <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> device can't do and more and better.
I went GS3 over <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> simply because I prefer the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> operating system.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> didn't out pace the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> this year, it just sold slightly better in America.
Not to mention that the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> phones deliver a far superior user experience overall.
The reason is simple: Apple's <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> is perceived by customers to be a better device than any <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> handset.
10 Things <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> Does Better Than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> OS
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> phones have better processing power than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>
Just another step towards showing that <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> is ultimately better than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> OS Google Maps app is better integrated than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> app.
The version for the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> was pathetic , and the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> version is no better.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> phones may have eclipsed the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> in specs, and the UI is only getting better.
The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> may just blow us away again, regardless of how many of you think <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> is so superior.
It's better than any <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> phone I've tested thus far.
EVERYONE that bothers to do research knows <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> can do more and is better than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
That's because certain products or services do better on certain carriers or devices, and it's possible to target ads at that level on <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> by not <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
In reply to Only a hill: "The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> has a notoriously inaccurate internal compass, but most <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> handsets are better".
Its better specs will make it more competitive against the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> 4S and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> superphones.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> provides better Utility to us than an equivalent <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I think Apple is doing this because better apps is pretty much the only thing that's better about the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> is older and has a broader and better range of applications available than in the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> Market.
Owning an <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> smartphone just got even better with Pebble , the first watch designed for the 21st century.
It's all down to personal preference just because your happier with <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> doesn't mean <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> users are using an inferior device.
Google shouldn't have mandated an inferior map app on the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> (as opposed to <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>).
I can say, hands down, the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span>/iPod touch UI is much better implemented than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> is on the Droid.
Microsoft Windows Phone 8 review: Better than <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>?
I, and millions of others, like my <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> better than the equivalent <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
The apps for the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> are generally better than those for <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> (for example, consider The Weather Network apps).
There are a dozen <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> phones for which the hardware is superior to the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Overall, this is a great phone and definitely better than the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> 5 because of its speed, screen size, screen quality, hardware, and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> 4.0.4
I'm in the minority because I am using an <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> and not an <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
To me it is much better than <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
For web even good smart phone (<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>, etc.) is way better than ereader.
There are <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> devices which have vastly superior battery life and screens than an <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> has a superior number of good apps, though <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> phones counter with good alternatives.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> seems to be better at offering a wider selection of models than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Otherwise, the hardware platform looks to be very competitive with <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> handsets, with many models having specs superior to those of the Apple <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> 4.
I love <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> because the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> might be coming to Verizon and I could care less.
In my opinion its superior when compared to the built in email clients on <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> or  <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
This really better be good, because BlackBerry apps aren't that great compared to <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> or potentially <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I am a family medicine physician , and for me <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> is still superior to the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> ( i am talking about the personal use )
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> is Robot Jesus because it breaks through that wall, but <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> will be even bigger.
I say this with sadness, because so far I like the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> OS much better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I sold off my <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> 4 thinking I would like the features of the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> phone better.
Lots of people buy an <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> phone because it is cheaper than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
If you happen to like <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> better, why make it a point to bash <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span> constantly?
The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> is cool, I think the SDK for <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> is a tick better and a bit...
that is why you consider your <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> better then <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
5 Ways The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> Is Better Than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>
Even better, it supports multiple book readers: <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>, Nook, Web.
We can't let him walk away thinking that his precious <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> is that  much better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> now can we?
SO is not a place for questions like which is better, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span>?

If you look at the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_B]</span> devices, their graphics look a lot better than the Wii.
Any modern <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">android:[OBJECT_A]</span> phone today has the same level or better build quality than any <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">iphone:[OBJECT_B]</span>.

That's false, putting the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> before the horse, because the Dutch used a great deal of <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> transportation before there were any bikeways.
Also it is nice because a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> has a lower depreciation rate than a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
A bit like complaining because a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> isn't a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
There was a time when we were homeless, living out of her <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span>, because all I had was a BMX <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>."
We think they'd be better off with an actual <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span>, or perhaps a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>, or a Segway.
Although I can rollerskate, ride a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span>, and drive a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>, I can neither ice skate nor swim because of my balance, coordination, time, and fear.
But, ironically, on the same streets where I can't drive a Kei <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> because they are too dangerous, I can ride my 1972 Raleigh 3spd <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I had been riding a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> back and forth to work for several years because my <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> broke down beyond my financial ability to have it repaired.
I once heard a guy threaten to murder his next door neighbor's little kids because one of them scratched his <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> with their <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>," my neighbor says.
The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> movement seems to be accelerating in a region known far better for its love affair with the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Just because you have a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> or a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> doesn't mean you can't share the road safely and happily.
We can also help you rent a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span>, motorcycle or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> with which you can discover better Florence.
Why ride hundreds of miles on a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> when you can drive in a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>, or better yet fly in a plane?
I have opted to not own a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> because I can certainly survive with the public transit system and a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
 Protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy, because they show that a citizen on a $30 <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> is equally important to one in a $30,000 <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>."
Perhaps that's why driver are so courteous to bike riders there, because they appreciate that it's a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> in front of them, and not another <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I'd like better information on road closures and maintenance - up-to-date info on all activities that significantly affect transportation by <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> OR <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Would it protect my noggin better in the chance of a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span>-vs-<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> mishap?
Where there isn't room in the far right lane for a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> AND a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>, I will occupy the center of that lane, because I don't want people trying to squeeze by me at 40mph in that narrow space.
I walked everywhere because I did not have a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span>, and took the bus or my <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Then you would type, "I don't want a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> because I have a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>."
The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> may turn out to be a much better product than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> originally envisioned .
Adolf Hitler on a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> would be a better person than Albert Schweitzer in a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>"
Trip lengths by <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> are up in Copenhagen - and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> trips are down - simply because it's a pain to drive in the city because of all the construction at the moment.
I know a few cases of dog having bad heart problems because their owner would make them run behind a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> or a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Yet Orcutt's main support for the tax comes from his belief that riding a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> is worse than driving a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> for the environment.
That my employer does not pass these costs along (like they do with <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> parking) might be because the building management does not explicitly charge for <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> parking.
I am currently looking for a job, and because I already commute everywhere on my bike and live <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> free, I thought that I might look into being a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> courier.
It is great that I can be here and take my medications and not be in a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> or on a train (or worse, a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> lol).
Another illustration of how <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> lanes are counterproductive: I recently had to swerve out of the bike lane and into the traffic stream because there was a parked <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> blocking the bike lane.
I like having a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span>, not as nice as yours but a lot better than a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I was stationed in Germany ( Aschaffenburg ) near Frankfurt in the US Army Corps of Engineers and wanted to buy a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> because all I had was my <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> as transportation.
One <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> was covered with ice because the door was opened.
I have a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> and it could easily be three weeks where I don't touch it because it's smarter to walk, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> or take the bus or metro to most destinations.
This is partly because it is smaller and more nimble in the same way a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> is smaller and more nimble than a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>, but it's also because the simple fact is that lots of people ride bikes.
Do yourself a favor, park (or better yet sell) the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span>, ride a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> or take public transportation.
You can do it because you personally are looking for a alternative to the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> or a way to decrease the use of the ICE so you decide to use a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Long ago, I was in a similar situation, after getting fired from my <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> messenger job in SF because I had to be off work after getting hit by a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I said the police seemed to have got above themselves, and that the Chief Whip was mainly in trouble because he rode a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> instead of sprawling in a chauffeured <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Maybe it's because I always expect a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> to dip into the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> lane without giving a shit when I'm riding but I fear that someone else might not be as experienced as a rider.
Nearly half the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> rides that occur in Beijing are less than five kilometers, a distance that can be better travelled via <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> or walking.
People seems to forget that Chinese people uses <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> because they don't have much money to buy a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>!
it's perfect for a summer vacation because you are really close to the beach (5 min by <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> or 10' by <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>) and the city cen...
I called Shadyside Honda because it was the dealer that was best situated so that when they had my <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> I could still get from the shop to home and to work on my <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Then, we need to take alternative transportation seriously, and make it better to take busses or <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> (in this wonderful climate) or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> pool.
This fish does not need a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span>, because it has a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>!
A <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span>, after all, is absolutely not a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> - it can stop faster, gives a better field of view, and is much more efficient when moving than when stopped.
Comparing them is like saying a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> hitting you at 90mph shouldn't kill you because a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> hitting you at 5mph wouldn't kill you.
So I can share this secret: A <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> is better than a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
5. Just because you ride a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> doesn't mean you are better than drivers, it only means you can't afford a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
They have that personal relationship with me, because I am on the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> and it's easier to approach me than it is somebody in the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>," Raines said.
For all of the arguments to the effect that because this was a bicyclist it is "understandable" I want you to go back and substitute the word Tractor or "slow moving <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span>" instead of <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Seven months on, he can no longer ride a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> or drive a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> because the stroke left him with half the peripheral vision in his left eye.
Last night, the Tigers lost a baseball game because Jack Cust, who if he was a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> or a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> would be equipped with squares for wheels, beat out an infield single in the 11th inning.
Is a motor <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> better than a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>?
That doesn't mean that a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> is superior to a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Some may think that riding a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> on busy roads is a bad idea, but it's environmentally friendly and good for your health, plus it's better and cheaper than owning a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Or do you think <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> seller win <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> seller because they sell more bikes.
1. Roof Mounted <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> Racks: This is a convenient arrangement because the back of the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> is not blocked in any way.
Choosing vacation rentals and lodging located in the heart of Sunriver means you can leave the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> behind and explore on foot or, better yet, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
The campaign enraged <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> advocates because it seemed to mirror the placement of white Ghostbikes across the city, symbols of fatal <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>-v-bike smashes.
There is no better rush than the feel of traveling great distances with your <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> and discovering new places that you normally don't appreciate as well with your <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
don't worry about blinding drivers because <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span> headlights are many times brighter than any <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span> light.
I cannot think of a better solution for keeping the front wheel of a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> stable when traveling with your bike hanging on the rear bike rack of a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
However, I have no problem with a portion of the taxes I pay being used for Muni because I understand how very much I benefit from Muni's existence whether I take Muni, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> or drive my <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Scooter rides are a great way to take in the Emerald Coast's natural beauty because they are more intimate than a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_A]</span>, but require far less effort than a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Remember the guy who drives his <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> because nobody will approve him for a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> loan?
So unless you want <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> to smash <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> better let them share the road with other vehicules.
i used to have a motorbike and sold it because i'm just stuck in traffic on queen/spadina/front. now i just ride my <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span> everywhere on wknds and only use the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span> to get to work.
Moreover, when going by <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bicycle:[OBJECT_A]</span>, landscapes and sightseeing places can be seen better than when hurrying by <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">car:[OBJECT_B]</span>.

Enjoy this <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">summer:[OBJECT_A]</span> / <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">winter:[OBJECT_B]</span> reading.

And because parsley is available year round, it's good in <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">summer:[OBJECT_A]</span> and good in <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">winter:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
The only thing worse than a disappointing season is <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">winter:[OBJECT_A]</span>, spring and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">summer:[OBJECT_B]</span> with no football.
So like many people you probably notice you get worse gas mileage in the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">winter:[OBJECT_A]</span> than in the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">summer:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Honestly the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">winter:[OBJECT_A]</span> medals have been better than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">summer:[OBJECT_B]</span> medals since 1992 with Albertville's.
We found the area beautiful in the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">winter:[OBJECT_A]</span> and even better in the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">summer:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I confess that I like the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">winter:[OBJECT_A]</span> Olympics better than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">summer:[OBJECT_B]</span> games.
I have cars with both, and the cloth is infinitely better in <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">winter:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">summer:[OBJECT_B]</span> extremes.

<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> and Audi also make an appearance with the senior set, probably because they have money to spare and can't take it with them when they check out.
I use voice commands which in my experience works better than Honda's, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span>, or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
The Leith <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> finance manager just came over from <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> a week ago, his price is retail $3200 for the 6/100k and he doesn't know how to find out how to get a better price.
Manufacturers like Ferrari, Honda, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> too(me thinks) were here because of the limelight that they could be in.
Do you think people drive luxury cars, like a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> Benz or a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span>, because of the great gas mileage?
The Germans have high labor costs as well but are doing just fine because either they're assembling in Eastern Europe or building expensive cars with higher margins (Audi, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span>).
The IS250's V6 would be cool: people underrate that engine largely because they haven't driven the equally dog-a-riffic <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> 323i or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> C250, but it is smooth and revs nicely.
Those seeking a diesel that gets near or better than 40 mpg, meanwhile, can shop Audi, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>-Benz or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
It's no surprise to hear that Hyundai has recruited <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> designers (and some from <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span>) because the i40 has more than a hint of Merc CLS about it.
And that's where the Q45 gets hurt no matter how good the car because Infiniti just does not have the image of Lexus, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
And <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> is even loosing straight-line battles with the porkers over at <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> (the M6 looses out to the Sl600, and that's a shame because I hate the SL).
What they don't realize is that Cadillac is far superior to most of the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> they hold so dear.
Of course Volvo marketers would prefer you cross-shop the S80 against the E-Class <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> and 5 series <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> as well as the Audi A6, because then the $37,200 price tag will seem like a bargain.
Oh, and <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> don't want to make $15,000 cars because they want to be known only as prestigious and high end.
Also, Audi is selling better than <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span>-Benz in Germany, which is the companies' home market, obviously.
There are not huge aspirations for Malibu because the (midsize) segment here is not so big and is dominated by the premium brands like Audi, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I am so hoping they did a better job with this car because I love my <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> - but can we get something like what's in the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> or the Cadillac CTS?
Drivetrain Due to its much higher torque, the engine of the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>-Benz E-Class does a much better job of transmitting power to the wheels than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> 528.
For bold styling, the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>-Benz CLA is a better choice, while the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> 2 Series Coupe is arguably more thrilling to drive.
As a fact in term of durability and comfiort , <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> is much better than any <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
This year, it's unlikely to finish better than third behind <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span>-Benz...
With that said, I still feel as though <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>-Benz and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> both produce much, much better-looking cars and SUVs than Lexus.
Spend just a bit of time behind the wheel of one and you'll see that driving a Maserati vs a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> is so much better it's not a difference in degree it's a difference in type.
The Alfa Romeo Giulia's most sporty version will offer more power than rival models from <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> because it will use Maserati's Ferrari-derived 510-hp V-6 engine.
But it was not quite that easy for Williams because the story of the race was not one of Williams-<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> domination but rather one of <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span>-Benz getting ahead and then losing.
The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> is more spacious, but the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> is a better car in almost every other area.
Defending and vice champions Bruno Spengler and Gary Paffett also fell afoul of the unpredictable conditions with the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> man narrowly getting the better of Spengler's <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> in sixth and seventh.
However, it's better than its <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> rivals.
So most German car manufacturers like Audi, VW, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> will give you 10+ years of warranty on the chassis of the car because they all know that their cars will turn to rust in 5 or 6 years?
The rear seat of the ATS isn't any worse than the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> 328i or the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span>-Benz C-Class.
I'm guessing this CLA will have better luck in the USA than the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> 318ti and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> Coupe.
The M4 is a standard <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>/Audi/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> tire that provides superior comfort and some sportiness.
2-You must go pick her up in a nice car (<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> preferably) because now, almost any moldovan guy owns one and she has become used to it!
Truthly I've liked <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> as a company better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> for a while now.
Daimler faces fierce pressure from analysts despite enjoying record car sales at its core <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>-Benz brand, because <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> and Audi are selling more cars and reaping higher profit margins.
Much better than what <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> have done in my opinion.
Driving Mummy's Audi, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span>, you are clearly a superior being.
For the first time EVER there are some <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> models that handle better than their <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> counterparts.
The new V60 wagon, part of Volvo's plan to better compete with Audi , <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> , and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span>-Benz , just entered production today.
It boasts class-leading rear legroom-better than luxury sedans such as the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>-Benz E-class, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> 5 Series and Lexus LS.
@Alpha - That is like saying, would a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> M5 or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> S class lose value just because they offer cheaper options?
lexus is definitely on par with if not better than <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span>, or audi.
Jaguar is looking to expand beyond its current three-model line (and the upcoming F-Type roadster) to better compete with German rivals <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span>, Audi and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
If Chrysler or Jeep doesn't have a great designer just do what Kia and Hunday does , copy and paste from <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> even Audi and the result is better than this thing .
I really wanted a used <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> primarily because they were great handling rear-wheel drive cars.
Acura needs to market their vehicles better, Acura is not thought of as being as prestigious than <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span>, Lexus and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> even though their product is just as good if not better.
I personally never want to own a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span>/Audi, because I do not need or have a desire to own a luxury car.
Plus, there are so many better options like the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> c-class estate, Audi A4 wagon, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> 3 series touring, and so on.
Toyota created Lexus twenty years ago because it felt that it needed a specific brand cache to go against <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span>, Audi, Cadillac, etc.
Since then <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> were always lacking in outright power compared to the Ferrari and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> power units, and they had far worse reliability.
Of course, that hasn't stopped <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> making good money over the years, but that's because they can charge premium prices and people will still pay.
I've owned a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> 3 series and test drove the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> C250 and this car is so much better.
Also engineering goes to the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> with always having the edge, better brakes, better suspension... they just make the speed and handling way more efficient than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> does.
It is better you just go and buy a second hand <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> because the depreciation of the 2nd year onwards is very minimal.
The all-wheel-drive systems that <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_B]</span> use are built from rear-wheel-drive cars and have the ability to send more than half the power to the rear for better handling.
i think this car is a far better deal than the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> 5 series or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> 320e.
Where I live is actually a good case study really because on one road (Ogden Ave.) we have Lexus, Audi, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> all right next to each other.
A better way to look at it is a person buying a Hyundai Genesis when they are used to a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span> 5 series or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> Benz E class.
The handling, ride, and power are better than <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">bmw:[OBJECT_A]</span>, Lexus, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">mercedes:[OBJECT_B]</span> or any other import car.

<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> after <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span>, oh dear"?
I'll have <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>.

That's good news because <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> is increasingly competing with spirits and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>, both of which are enjoying higher per-capita consumption."
Moderate consumption of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span>, whisky or liqueur is known to be beneficial for improving health because of the radical scavenging action of antioxidants present in them.

Just note that <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> bottles because of their greater mass and volume will require longer pasteurizing/flash/contact time than smaller thinner <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> bottles.

ught a beverage - say, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> - just because you liked the bottle it came in?
The NDP has also opposed the sale of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> in convenience stores, but has said the system could work better.
Let's make some <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> sorbet, because I am more than certain a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> popsicle might be a little weird - or would it?
Cans are better for storage: Light and air affect the quality of the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> (and all food products-including <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>, olive oil, and spices).
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> are even worse for triggering the reaction, so I have the least risk with gin/tonic.
That's because Starbucks announced it will sell <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> in thousands of stores after 4 p.m.
Even better, you can get them to bring you <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>, and pints of ice cream, too.
If so, make your party even better by choosing wonderful <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> selections to go along with delicious cheeses.
You can buy this <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> cheaply and in bulk , but maybe you're better off just having a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Children were allowed in the bar, because it was really a restaurant with a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> license.
The $3.2 million expansion is necessary because of growth in Wright-Wisner's craft <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> segments, company officials said.
Quality, selection - I swear, this place has a better selection than Total <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span>, even though there's just one little wall of <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> and a few coolers.
Different swimsuits for different folks.The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> drinking British men avoid speedos while the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> drinking and better diet eating French men want to show off their figures.
Add $5 <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span>, and tasty snacks - Even better.
And I do not understand you rational: you let your 3 yr old to sip <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> because children and adults do not like the taste?
No surprise: any American could probably guess that American <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> drinkers in general tend to be better educated and wealthier than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> drinkers.
First was a report that <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> had an equal or better effect on health than red <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>.

As a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span>, I have had much more enjoyable, as a barley <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>, it is better than I remembered.
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> goes better, I must admit, but <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> is alright as well.
I would say this is a great <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> for <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> drinkers, but I have had way better from Ommegang.
And the consensus seems to be that a high-quality red organic <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> is better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Sometimes <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> does go better with certain foods than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> does.
Wash it down with a normal-size soda, a cup of coffee, or better yet a cocktail or a glass of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I watched this while drinking a Gnarly <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span>, partly because of the 9.7 alcoholic content in an 11 oz.
It's pretty fucked up in PA because supermarket mammoth Giant Eagle can sell <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> because they bought a bulk licence to be able to do it.

Anyway, Beef Carbonnade is cooked in beef stock and <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> (we used Guinness Extra Stout mostly because it was cheap) rather than cheap red <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> like the Bourguignon.
Although, I say "YAY" with the stipulation of "just don't drink huge amounts of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> or large mixed drinks" because those have many more calories than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Here, Super Coop is at a disadvantage because they aren't licensed to sell hard alcohol; they only have <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
(I've always found poster sessions to be the best networking environment, better than coffee breaks or the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span>-and-<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> event on the first evening of a conference.
It's a great way to round out the week, and also fun because we'll have some <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span>  and some of my favorite  local <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> and snacks .
Governor LePage has proposed modifying the Kid-Safe Products Law, mainly because the law could ban almost 2,000 common consumer products, including <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>, toothpaste and bicycles.
The "two-buck Chuck" remains in the fridge because on Friday nights, I swear off the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span>; the only thing I drink is <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
A decent store for <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> (though more <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> oriented), made better that they are next door to Lush.
We'll forgive the tiny tasting glasses (only <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> should come in 'flights') because they also served <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> in pints and some of it was even good.
The other section of the store (not connected, I'm guessing because of NYS law regarding liquor stores and <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span>) had a very extensive <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> and liquor store.
If you're looking for quality and great prices, there is no better place to stock up on <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span>, spirits, and high-gravity <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> than Grace's.
But things could be better because the dinner/bar/dessert tail end of our daily program is simply waiting for our anchor: the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> program.
If someone in your party doesn't like <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> then have no fear because they do <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> tasting too!
Heck in pre-modern time <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> were health foods because they were often safer to drink than water, which was often contaminated.
The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> list is better than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> list, but that, too, changes frequently.
A side-effect is very likely to be an increased status for <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span>, probably gradually approaching the status of <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>, because for many people money really does talk.
In some ways, it's a more dynamic world than that of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span>, because the time from getting an idea to enjoying a completed <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> is so short.
A guy has a HBS called Strange Brew <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> & <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> Making Supplies and he wants to sue another company because they are named Strange Brewing Company?
I'm glad we liked the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> pairing better than we liked the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> pairing!
Along with the dish soap the 3 different things we used were <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> (they love it), <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> (they love that better!) and some ruby red grapefruit juice.
I find that using a tart Belgian <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> like a lambic or oud bruin works even better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> when braising beef.
That's because it's illegal to send <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> or spirits through the mail in this country.

Courtesy of Marylanders for Better <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> & <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> Laws, here's a summation of what was debated and discussed.
The spectacular Indian chicken enchiladas are better matched with <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> than with <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Complex is not the word for this <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span>, better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> is bold and fitting.
NOFO gift baskets are particularly interesting because they contain a mixture of packaged foods, freshly prepared foods, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> & gift items from the retail store.
This means stale <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span> is worse than fresh.
I think <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_A]</span> matches food better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Its <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">wine:[OBJECT_A]</span> list is approachable, cocktails and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beer:[OBJECT_B]</span> better than average, the service is excellent, and the prices are in line with the quality of the food.

The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">usa:[OBJECT_A]</span> was 8 or 10 times worse than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">europe:[OBJECT_B]</span>, any warnings there then?

<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">europe:[OBJECT_A]</span> has starved itself, spending-wise for 30-40 years, even worse than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">usa:[OBJECT_B]</span>, and has erected the most insane monetary institutions in the history of humanity.
You must not be a long-time reader here, because one of our recurring themes is that the fate of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">europe:[OBJECT_A]</span> is crucial to that of the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">usa:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I ask because i'm in <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">europe:[OBJECT_A]</span> and have 'E' and I noticed that someone in the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">usa:[OBJECT_B]</span> mentioned their firmware revvision in a post and they had a 'U'.

There is no real <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> equivalent to the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> tailgate because there never needed to be one.
The design may be suitable for team sports such as <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span>, and basketball, because the squads compete weekly and therefore have more data for analysis.
Touting "Hydrating Gel Reservoir," the new ads used <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> themes to say men prefer the Schick Hydro 5 over Gillette Fusion ProGlide at a better price.
I love <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> because it's a different way to compete other than physically like in <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> or basketball.
Sometimes I feel like I would be a better American if I could just give two hoots about <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Is like putting <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> players on a <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> field to play a game they cannot because the playing feild is not set up for it.
Making <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> have an 18 game season makes better sense than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> anyway.
He decided to play <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> when he could have made a lot more money at <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> because he loved the game.
I actually like <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>, which believe it or not is my least favorite sport to watch.
What <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> do have is a long tradition of popularity, that however, does not mean they are better.
The Cyclones are basically Missouri with worse <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> and no <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span>, and that overall strength gets ISU the #10 spot.
Folks in TX like high school & college <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
What I tell all of them is, you'd better understand that <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> is just as important to him as <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Im pretty certain that <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> are more accepted because they are more appealing to a much larger percentage of the population.
I also think the mainstream coverage of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> is better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span>, in terms of actually talking about every team.
Unlike soccer, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>, basketball uniforms are limited, from a fashion perspective, because they are sleeveless.
Though the beautiful game may not interest us as much as <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>, there's no shame in loving it because it belongs to our country.
San Antonio is a possibility because they are dangling money for new stadiums in hope of getting a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> and or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> team.
Perhaps <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> really does have a better claim to be a "pastime" in the sense of a pleasant leisure hobby or pursuit, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> is something more.
Why <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> is better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>
There is a reason why college <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> is inferior to its <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> and basketball counterparts and this is it.
Now, just because I'm getting excited for <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> doesn't mean I'm giving up on <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> for the year.
Imagine your children relentlessly bullied at school, at church, at soccer/<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span>/<span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> because they're yours.
He plays <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span>, basketball, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>, and will definitely be in track because, as he says it himself, he's fast.
The only reason I love Fantasy <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> is because it means D.W. comes into town and I get to see these guys.
I personally quit watching <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span>, my favorite, 20 years ago because of the cheating and records broken by deceitful players using steroids.
Hampton revealed that he decided to play <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> instead of <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> because he was "Craig Biggio sized."
I think <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> work better on television than opera because they use technology.
I'm not sure if it's better now, but I use ESPN for basketball and <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> updates so it seems like they should have a good <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> update.
A lot of these athletes in American professional sports have kinda let us down in a lot of the institutions, for better or for worse, be it <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>, or basketball," he explains.
The stands that move for <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> could be made permanent and angled better for <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> sightlines.
I reckon Golf is probably a better reference point as it is a TV based individual sport without the big weekly stadium crowds of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> etc..
The home field advantage was very evident because unlike <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> or basketball players, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> players are not use to playing in this environment," he said.
Sanders was the flashy one who was better at <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
not worried if you <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> game early in the year because you know there's going to be a 100 more to watch but <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> every game count's
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span>: This sport is interesting, because on its face, it's a game that values a players' overall strength and athletic ability much more than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Um,yeah,and I will also give up basketball and <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> because I criticize losers.
RACING Because <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span>, bowling and golf only require ONE BALL
<span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span> camps at the YMCA were canceled this summer because of a lack of interest.
I'll be happy to go to a game or two when he's not there because its <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> not <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> or basketball.
Think that would be a little worse than a <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> strike?
If you have <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span>, hockey and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> players, you will need spacious athletic lockers because their equipment can get quite bulky.
Just as batting average is better known but overrated in <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span>, so too is completion percentage in <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
He said even though he loved playing the hot corner, this would be his last year to play <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> because he really wanted to concentrate on <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Using steroids is cheating in <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> because drugs and other substances are banned.
There's no doubt that <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> is better than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
Mostly the dearth of female athletic heroes is because our nationally televised sports are all male dominated: basketball, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I think that <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_A]</span> has done a better job of tackling the issue from a PR perspective than <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
In the 1980s Vans took a turn for the worse, when the known skate company started to produce <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">baseball:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">football:[OBJECT_B]</span> sneakers.

GIVE IT A REST: <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span>, steak, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span> -- almost anything you grill-will taste better if you let it stand on the cutting board for a few minutes before serving.
That is because it takes close to 15 pounds of grain to make 1 pound of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span> meat and about 5 pounds of grain to create 1 pound of <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
We did notice that switching to no wheat, <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span> protein she did a LOT better.
We definitely are able to move more lamb because we have <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span>," said Stone.
Vitamin B12 from foods appear to have different absorption rates with better absorption from <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span> as compared to eggs.
But this issue was right up my alley: pan-seared <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> breasts, everyday <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span> stroganoff, better stir-fried broccoli.
Today I'm addressing protein - <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span>, pork, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span>, fish - because protein is often the most expensive component of a meal.
For example, he likes to use local <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span> fat in place of olive oil because it is less expensive and can be produced at home, he said.
It's not that I like pork better than say <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span>, but as far as industrial/conventional meat goes, it's probably the worst of the three.
The son I raised would never have asked to have <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> instead of taco meat, because that son would have been considerate of the fact that his mother slaved over that ground <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
When I made that my husband thought it was the weirdest thing to do, because it was <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> flavor with ground <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I had recently enjoyed a maple and mustard glazed <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> and I was thinking that the corned <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span> would be even better with a sweet and tangy honey mustard glaze.
I like it more than Baja Fresh because in addition to steak and <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span>, they have ground <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
DH and I might like to try <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span> broth for our sauce next time, however, because it might make it a little thicker and give it that meatier flavor we carnivores were looking for.
If you shy away from saltimbocca because you don't eat veal, then do yourself a favor and try this twist on the classic Roman dish, which uses <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> in place of <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
The <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span> in the hamburger was hideous, but I ate it anyway because I was so hungry, and I knew I had the delicious taste of old deep-fried <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span> to chase it down.
We order this because the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span> are very tender and we love the peanut sauce they serve with the barbecued meat.
Not the most nutritious of foods; in retrospect, I'd probably would have been no worse off if I'd stuck with water and homemade <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span> broths, especially since I'd been told to avoid dairy.
I'll have to try your <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> version, it sounds even better than with <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
I added bell pepper and used ground <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> in place of <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span>, just because that's what I had.
Rosemary is a favorite herb of many cooks because it enhances the flavor of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span>, fish and vegetable dishes.
A new study runs the numbers on the environmental impact of mealworm farming, and no surprise, the numbers are much better than those for <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span>, <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span> or pork farming.
I made them with <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> meat, because now days many people are not eating <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
This year I'm going to make them with half ground pork and half ground <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> because I have a hard time digesting <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span> and therefore almost never eat it.
No way in hell can I (currently) afford the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span> and <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span> that is better for me.
I made stuffed pepper soup out of <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> stock, tomato sauce, ground <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span> and chopped peppers (sometimes rice, sometimes not, liked it better without).
Of course it would be better if you added some meat like <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_A]</span> or pork or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_B]</span> and some vegetables like onions, carrots and potatoes.
It was amazing and better than <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> or <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span>!
I give this one 7.5/10 , the half-point deduction due to the <span style="color: #9A14B2; font-weight: bold">chicken:[OBJECT_A]</span> being better than the <span style="color: #6CB219; font-weight: bold">beef:[OBJECT_B]</span>.
