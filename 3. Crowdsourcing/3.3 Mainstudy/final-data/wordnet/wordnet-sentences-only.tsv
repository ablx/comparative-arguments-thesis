3765	Since our Earth moves faster at Perihelion ! and slower at Aphelion !	aphelion	perihelion	False
3766	Southern summer in January (perihelion) is therefore cooler than northern summer in July (aphelion).	aphelion	perihelion	False

3776	So, figuring from this fairly rock solid premise (and assuming 4 seasons of roughly equal length, unlike the Celts, who really only had Summer and Winter), the Vernal Equinox would be the middle of Spring, the Summer Solstice the middle of Summer (or MidSummer !) and the Autumnal Equinox on around March 21st would be the mid-point of Autumn.	vernal equinox	autumnal equinox	False

3831	From the results of this experiment, and particularly because of the wrinkled appearance of the product at the slowest speed and the tendency of the dough sheet to tear and adhere to the brush at faster speeds, it was concluded that for sheeted potato products the practical lower limit of dockering brush speed was about 60% of belt speed for thin products and 50% for thicker products, and up to a maximum of about 106% of the brush speed for both dough thicknesses.	lower limit	maximum	False

4264	That earlier album tightened the chains on Wild Beasts for the better, introducing a tamer texture to their repertoire but equally displaying a deeper and darker conceptual focus, which allowed their deft lyrical precision and dueling vocals to come to the forefront and blend into a devastatingly beautiful forty minutes, front to back.	tamer	wild	False
4265	What I hate about such "Technology talk" is that it sustains the technophobe-technophile poles of the current debate, making it much harder to engage in substantial critiques of individual technologies-if only for the fear of being labeled a Luddite.	technophile	technophobe	False

4346	The accrual basis of accounting provides a better picture of a company's financial results than the cash basis of accounting.	accrual basis	cash basis	False

4350	Accrual basis accounting is more popular than cash basis accounting because it produces more accurate, more faithful financial statements that constitute better representations of actual circumstances than its main competitor.	accrual basis	cash basis	False
4351	That is, the National Income and Product Accounts  (NIPA)-the Department of Commerce's measure of national economic output-have changed accounting for defined benefit plans from a cash basis to an accrual basis, which is a much better measure of an employee's claim on the pension plan.	accrual basis	cash basis	False
4352	That is, the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)-the Department of Commerce's measure of national economic output-have changed accounting for defined benefit plans from a cash basis to an accrual basis, which is a much better measure of an employee's claim on the pension plan.	accrual basis	cash basis	False
4353	That there may be a purpose to life - better anabolism and or better catabolism.	anabolism	catabolism	False
4354	They are the two main ways of evolutionary change - either better catabolism, or better anabolism.	anabolism	catabolism	False
4355	Thus there is a sort of evolutionary motor directing evolution towards better catabolism, or anabolism.	anabolism	catabolism	False
4356	2)Whey + casein after training is better than whey alone (positive for both anabolism and anti-catabolism).	anabolism	catabolism	False
4357	Therefore by reducing the rate of catabolism, anabolism is increased, and results in faster recovery, an increased growth rate, and an overall higher level of performance.	anabolism	catabolism	False
4358	But with an immediate infusion of carbohydrates and protein, you can stop catabolism and start the reverse process, anabolism, better known as muscle-building.	anabolism	catabolism	False
4359	To a large extent, things are always simultaneously getting better and worse (like anabolism and catabolism), but we must try to ride the waves of the former, for they're always available.	anabolism	catabolism	False
4360	So, if there's too much growth hormone inside someone's body, maybe the metabolism will be faster (especially protein catabolism and anabolism) and this makes the cell reproduction and development faster also.	anabolism	catabolism	False
4361	Here's a short list: proper rehydration, muscle and liver glycogen resynthesis, improved immune function, decreased muscle catabolism, increased muscle protein synthesis, increased muscle anabolism, faster recovery and training at a higher intensity.	anabolism	catabolism	False
4362	For me, having protein, amino acids, carbohydrates and electrolytes in one formula means muscle and liver glycogen resynthesis, increased anabolism, decreased catabolism, increased protein synthesis, faster recovery and the ability to train at a higher intensity.	anabolism	catabolism	False
