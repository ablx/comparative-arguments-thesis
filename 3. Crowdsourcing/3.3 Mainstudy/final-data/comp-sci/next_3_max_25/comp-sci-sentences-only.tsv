3340	We could instead use ISO-8859-5 and KOI8-R as the combination, because they are both meant to represent Russian, in order to make this test meaningful on more platforms, but we already use Shift_JIS vs EUC-JP combinations to test other programs in our test suite, so this combination is safer from the point of view of the portability.
