1094	datatype is an integer (in Lisp, a symbol) that denotes the type of basic data: INTEGER REAL STRINGTYPE BOOLETYPE POINTER .	Lisp	Datatype	False
1095	To do so, see the Lisp function datatype-mapping and the Type mapping section in the HTTP Protocol document for information on modifying automatic mappings.	Lisp	Datatype	False
1096	Also, because Lisp was built on lists, it is very good at manipulating them, so they're most likely the most convenient datatype.	Lisp	Datatype	False

1101	(I'm not totally happy with my implementation, but that's another story...) It's funny that you think of the basic datatype of Lisp as a tree, though; I've never heard it expressed that way before.	Lisp	Datatype	False
1102	The most obvious example is that of the use of a reference to RAM storage to represent a functional object (e.g., a Lisp bignum ); traditional abstract datatype systems handle this situation by protecting the object from outside access either intentionally, through the published operations, or unintentionally, by clobbering storage through wild pointers.

1106	Standard ML (and, to the best of my knowledge, all other functional languages circa-1997) only provides a limited form of case analysis - arbitrary finite views into the outermost structure of the datatype:	Standard ML	Datatype	False

1114	For each kind of information which is available about a datatype, we can give inference rules for information of that kind, which can be thought of as extending the table of RDFS closure rules.	Closure	Datatype	False
1115	These can help us to diagnose a range of issues such as implicit datatype conversions (disabling index use, for example), view merging, transitive closure, predicate pushing, missing predicates and even excessive user-function calls.	Closure	Datatype	False
1116	As the title of the paper suggests, the specific concepts that Haskell provides but current mainstream languages do not are higher-order (parametrization by a function, sometimes called a "lambda" or a "closure") and datatype-generic (parametrization by a type functor) features.

Mercury	SISAL	True
1120	If Prolog nearly fits the bill, wouldn't a well-typed logic programming language, say, Mercury , or others, fair better than Haskell?	Mercury	Haskell	False
1121	If you know order dependencies due to uniqueness typing (Clean, Mercury) or monads (Haskell) then a higher level language is easier to optimize because the optimizer knows which rearrangements are safe.	Mercury	Haskell	False
1122	I consider Java to be a much superior language (and I'm glad I leapfrogged having to deal with C++!) and also give high marks to various declarative programming languages such as Prolog , Mercury , Haskell , etc. and to scripting languages such as Python , Ruby , Lua , etc.	Mercury	Haskell	False
1123	Try programming in Haskell or Mercury to see what I mean, or better yet try programming in Scala and interfacing with Java libraries; the difference in how much "correctness" the compiler is able to guarantee for you is striking when you compare the normal idiomatic Scala code using Scala libraries to the code that has to deal with Java libraries (I have actually done this, since I program a bit in Scala on Android).

1162	In addition, most modern functional languages (such as ML, Haskell, and Miranda) have flexible static type systems which support polymorphism and type inference.	Type inference	Miranda	True
1163	We develop a termination analysis for a higher-order functional language; the analysis incorporates and extends polymorphic type inference and axiomatizes a class of well-founded partial orders for multipleargument functions (as in Standard ML and Miranda).	Type inference	Miranda	True
1164	Please note that this is specific to Scala, and that there are other statically typed languages (most of the Miranda/Haskell/Clean family, most of the ML family, and a few scattered others) that use much more comprehensive and capable type inference algorithms than Scala uses.	Type inference	Miranda	True
1165	I think you just have to remember that Haskell's currying is a side effect (haha) of all functions only actually taking one argument.	Side effect	Currying	False
1166	Isn't it interesting that the MLr's got symmetry as a side-effect of supporting currying: Currying requires that functions have only one argument, so they say that multiple-arg functions are in fact single-arg functions with the arg being a tuple.	Side effect	Currying	False
1167	Garbage collection is particularly attractive for functional languages, such as the JAVA™ language (JAVA is a trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc.), Prolog, Lisp, Smalltalk, Scheme, Eiffel, Dylan, ML, Haskell, Miranda, Oberon, etc., which exhibit data sharing, delayed execution, and generally, less predictable execution orders than the procedural languages.

1170	Sure, without composition the function definition has more paranetheses, but the other features at play - currying, polymorphism, and even "point-free" style - conspire to give a very readable and concise definition of the function "mostCommon".	Polymorphism	Currying	False

1185	Functional programming, type inference, pattern matching, currying, partial application were demonstrated with Gofer, an early implementation of Haskell.	Gofer	Currying	False
1186	I think the main issue is that Erlang doesn't use currying (IIRC).	Erlang	Currying	False
1187	This means there's no partial function application in Erlang (and no currying), right?	Erlang	Currying	False
1188	@Coffe_Mug Also as Erlang functions with the same same and different arity (number of args) are different functions then currying becomes messy.	Erlang	Currying	False
1189	But Mercury also (unlike Prolog and Erlang) supports currying , where a(1) is a function that accepts a/2's second argument.	Erlang	Currying	False
1190	There would be some problems by having automatic currying in Erlang: first is arity, where module functions are identified with their names AND number of arguments (used for pattern matching, defining default values, etc).	Erlang	Currying	False
1191	I'd highly recommend Erlang, it's syntax is not the best, and you will probably miss currying, but the way functional concepts are used to advance concurrency is absolutely unmatched.	Erlang	Currying	False
1192	It's like someone had a sadistic sense of humour and wanted to screw peoples' mind up but then again that is what I've heard about Erlang syntax and functional programming in general (Clojures, Currying, Higher order functions, Lazy evaluation and recursion anyone?	Erlang	Currying	False

1196	Miranda, Haskell, SML, CL, Scheme, Qi, Ur, Clojure, Erlang, and Oz.	Erlang	Miranda	False
1197	Developed in the late 1980s, Erlang was modeled after concurrent languages such as Ada and Modula and functional languages such as ML and Miranda.	Erlang	Miranda	False
1198	Others would classify, besides the archetypal examples Haskell and Miranda, impure languages such as Standard ML, Scheme, Erlang, Objective Caml, and F# as functional.	Erlang	Miranda	False
1199	Steven: functional programming and dynamic typing are orthogonal concepts: there exist statically typed functional languages (Haskell, ML, Miranda) and there exist dynamically typed functional languages (Erlang, Clojure, Scheme.)	Erlang	Miranda	False
1200	Hence, lambas functions and expressions will see far more use by their inclusion into C++11, than they ever have or ever will through all of the FP languages -- Clean, Curry, Haskell, Miranda, Erlang, F#, Lisp, ML, OCaml, Q, Pure, Scala et al. -- combined.	Erlang	Miranda	False
1201	The dominating syntaxes today are those of more readable (as opposed to easily writable) languages like C (C++, C#, Java, Objective-C, Scala, Go, IML, CSS, JavaScript, and also Python), Pascal (Fortran 90+x), Smalltalk (Ruby), ML /Miranda (OCaml, Haskell, Erlang), and SGML (HTML, XML).

1225	Miranda was fortunate, however, that the drought that hurt other areas of Zona da Mata last year did not affect his lush valley.	Lush	Miranda	False
1226	Functional programming contains many useful and valuable constructs (like currying that Chris kindly enough explained) but it also contains an irritating feature called 'referential transparency'.	Referential transparency	Currying	False
1227	Naming function plus currying will make your function completely independent from the environment ("referential transparency"), making you programs safer and more modular.	Referential transparency	Currying	False
1228	I would like to point out a few problems with /implicit/ currying in Clojure; perhaps later.	Clojure	Currying	False
1229	I don't know if it's a good idea to have automatic-currying in everyday-Clojure-coding :) Bye, Alfredo	Clojure	Currying	False

1236	Our Linear Lisp Machine offers many of the same capabilities as combinator/graph reduction machines, but without their copying and garbage collection problems.	Graph reduction	Lisp	False
1237	These machines tend to suffer from the same problems as Lisp Machines, though: because the funding for development and implementation is many orders of magnitude less than that for conventional architectures, it is always better to wait a year and buy a conventional machine programmed to imitate (say) a graph reduction machine.	Graph reduction	Lisp	False
1238	Moreover, Scala supports multiple parameter lists, which is sometimes also referred to as currying , and which makes partial application easier:	Scala	Currying	False
1239	In this presentation, we focus on the parts of Scala are are functional in nature (rather than object-oriented), and study things like currying, partial function application, writing generic functional code, and some of the functional design approaches that can make coding easier.	Scala	Currying	False
1240	I've lately been thinking about the cathedral and the bazaar, worse is better, and other such essays in relation to how I feel about Scala vs Lisp.	Scala	Lisp	False
1241	I'm very pleased to see functional programming becoming mainstream with increased interest in Haskell and Lisp as well as solid options on the JVM in the form of Clojure and Scala.	Scala	Lisp	False
1242	But hey, if most of your business domain is better modeled with OO style objects and imperative code, no problem - Common Lisp, OCaml, and Scala can do that too.	Scala	Lisp	False
1243	Now I don't doubt you can do better than Java the language, and still remain in Java the ecosystem; Scala shows signs of actual adoption, and Clojure is an attempt at re-Flubbing Lisp.	Scala	Lisp	False
1244	So I'm certainly motivated by experience (including having used other languages like SML, Lisp/Scheme, touches of Prolog, Scala, Haskell) to want to be able to express things better.	Scala	Lisp	False
1245	Many perspectives were discussed, especially relating to metaprogramming (Lisp macros and Template Haskell).	Template Haskell	Lisp	False
1246	Preprocessing/macro system with the full power of the language, like Lisp or Template Haskell.	Template Haskell	Lisp	False
1247	Lisp macros: Why use macros when you can do it properly in Template Haskell!	Template Haskell	Lisp	False
1248	Template Haskell allows us to generate code at compile-time, in fashion similar to Lisp macros.	Template Haskell	Lisp	False
1249	The most powerful forms of metaprogramming (like in Common Lisp, Racket, Template Haskell, etc.) are in compile-time.	Template Haskell	Lisp	False
1250	So Template Haskell is less powerful than Lisp macros (and it lacks the runtime code-generation support of MetaOCaml).	Template Haskell	Lisp	False
1251	OCaml with currying:	OCaml	Currying	False
1252	SML (sometimes OCaml) traditionally relies on Tuples, not currying.	OCaml	Currying	False
1253	structures / algorithms class in OCaml while heavily abusing currying for a	OCaml	Currying	False
1254	One of the great things about OCaml (and most of its functionalistical kindred) is currying (or "partial application").	OCaml	Currying	False
1255	@JimmyHoffa: I don't know about SML, but I've used OCaml, which is similar, and it does support currying almost as ubiquitously as Haskell.	OCaml	Currying	False
1256	In Ocaml, you can use currying to cut down on those (I am sure there are ways of doing this in Perl as well).	OCaml	Currying	False
1257	And even if these languages didn't, F# (which is basically OCaml by another name) and Scala are merging the functional and object oriented disciplines on the CLR and JVM, bringing features like closures and currying to these platforms.	OCaml	Currying	False
1258	Since currying is so common and there is so much performance gain in treating it specially, OCaml does the trouble of applying multiple arguments at once when it can.	OCaml	Currying	False
1259	This is not at all uncommon in technical computing and is exactly the characteristic I was referring to: these solutions leverage features of the OCaml language like higher-order functions, currying and partial application but they have completely different performance requirements to those of Coq.	OCaml	Currying	False
1260	I haven't really picked up OCaml, but this tutorial in my opnion gives you a functional understanding (in the approach i mentioned before), better than other tutorials i know of, because they always talk about currying and other jargons in some computer science way, half of them they don't really understand.	OCaml	Currying	False
1261	What really matters is the new semantic world that functional programming opens up; each functional language i've tried came loaded with a handful of little conceptual treasures: type inference, first-class currying and functors in ocaml; lazy evaluation and monads in haskell (with the nicest quicksort evaluation i've ever seen); continuations and macros in scheme... no wonder that reading the python tutorial was so disappointing!	OCaml	Currying	False

1268	FSharp.Compatiblity - Compatibility libraries for F# for Haskell, Standard ML, OCaml and Scala.	OCaml	Standard ML	False
1269	The project requires knowledge of a functional programming language, such as standard ML, OCaml, or Haskell.	OCaml	Standard ML	False
1270	I worked through online tutorials for three languages: Standard ML, OCaml, and Haskell.	OCaml	Standard ML	False
1271	Ocaml is, but I think Standard ML is more likely what he used in undergraduate classes.	OCaml	Standard ML	False
1272	The Scala/F#/Ocaml/Standard ML/Haskell languages are very similar.	OCaml	Standard ML	False
1273	(The theorem prover itself is written in Standard ML, a close cousin of OCaml.)	OCaml	Standard ML	False
1274	But OCaml didn't appear until 1996 and it didn't inherit the Standard ML libraries.	OCaml	Standard ML	False
1275	These were ML (in the dialects of Standard ML and OCaml) and Haskell.	OCaml	Standard ML	False
1276	Thru the years, many variations came, including Standard ML, Caml, OCaml; Moscow ML, Alice, F#.	OCaml	Standard ML	False

1278	1. Currying, when passing a value to a higher-order function.	Higher-order function	Currying	True
1279	In this Scheme example, the higher-order function (f x) is used to implement currying .	Higher-order function	Currying	True
1280	It features higher-order function, function currying, string interpolation, lazy evaluation, monad, dynamic typing, simple syntax and semantics etc.	Higher-order function	Currying	True
1281	Currying is another way to transform a function by breaking an N-argument function to N single argument calls using a single higher-order function.	Higher-order function	Currying	True
1282	Other names of Lexical Scoping are Static Scoping or Closure .	Static scoping	Closure	False
1283	Note that modules form a closure over persistent variables used in the ruleset because of the static scoping or persistent variables in modules .	Static scoping	Closure	False
1284	We need to fix this & put static scoping in place; so at compile time we know where a name is meant to come from (the outer class, the builder etc) You can still implement your own delegate mechanism on a closure if you wish & we will put in place a builder mechanism in its place.	Static scoping	Closure	False
1285	However, some implementations of SML, including Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ), its syntactic variant Mythryl and Mlton , provide libraries that offer certain unsafe operations.	Mythryl	Standard ML	False
1286	Other important tools to help you produce better code are splint (security check), Valgrind (memory leak check etc.), and gprof (performance analysis, a.k.a.	gprof	Valgrind	False
1287	Valgrind is about 10X better and more useable than their checker tool, their profiler is ok (when it doesn't crash, which is once a day), but no better than gprof or Google's profiler for Android.	gprof	Valgrind	False

1306	This 1-day course introduces some of the tools that help identify the bottlenecks in both serial and parallel programs, covering simple profilers such as gprof, and more complex utilities such as Scalasca.	Scalasca	gprof	False
1307	Using gprof or scalasca or openspeedshop (all free software) or Intel's VTune or something (commercial package) will give you the information about how much time is being spent on that line -- often even by thread -- with much lower overhead.	Scalasca	gprof	False

4454	Coq is not even turing complete.	Turing	Coq	False
4455	Just because Agda and Coq are total , it doesn't make them "non-Turing-complete".	Turing	Coq	False
4456	Hello, yes, Agda and Coq are Turing complete after all, in any sense that matters.	Turing	Coq	False
4457	Coq , Agda , HOL and ACL2 are very useful and extremely powerful languages, although they're not Turing-complete.	Turing	Coq	False

4459	Yes, you could accomplish things in non-Turing languages, but I can't imagine some actually saying "I want to do X" and my answer being "Use Coq".	Turing	Coq	False
4460	Second of all I don't think there are a lot of people who would call languages like Coq or Agda (which are total and thus not turing complete) primitive or toy languages.	Turing	Coq	False
4461	However there are non-Turing complete languages like for example Coq , Agda or Microsoft Dafny for which the Halting Problem is decidable (and in fact is decided by their respective type systems, making them total languages (i.e. a program that might not terminate will not compile)).	Turing	Coq	False
4462	Regarding the formalized Church-Turing thesis: if that takes the form of a proof every program written in one programming language has an equivalent program in another, I would think something like CompCert (a compiler which is proven in Coq to be semantics-preserving) would be an example.	Turing	Coq	False
4463	2 Even where we can prove the semantics of a program, e.g. with the language Coq, this is limited to the semantics that are expressed in the typing , and typing can never capture all of the semantics of a program- not even for languages that are not Turing complete, e.g. with HTML+CSS it is possible to express inconsistent combinations which thus have undefined semantics.
