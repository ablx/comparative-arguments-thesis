3872	My Taurus PT1911 is superior to my Springfield Mil-Spec by leaps and bounds.	Springfield	Taurus	True
3873	It is superior to Taurus, low end Springfield, Para, and S&W in my opinion.	Springfield	Taurus	True
3874	Springfield and Ruger have much better customer service records than Taurus.	Springfield	Taurus	True
3875	I shoot the Springfield XD 40 way better then my Ruger SR9 and my Taurus 24/7 compact 40.	Springfield	Taurus	True
3876	The reason you don't read criticism about Springfield Armory, Taurus, and Walther is they have better lock designs.	Springfield	Taurus	True
3877	The Taurus model 1911B-BHW is also a great 45 caliber handgun with more features and better warranty than the Springfield Armory product at about the same price.	Springfield	Taurus	True
3878	You said the Taurus felt better and no doubt it's the grip so try a springfield XD you'll really like the feel of that grip compared to the glock.	Springfield	Taurus	True
3879	Comparing the Range Officer to my previously reviewed Taurus PT1911 and Ruger SR1911, there is no comparison in fit; the Springfield is a world tighter in every aspect, and smoother, better sights, and with a better trigger and in most cases more accurate.	Springfield	Taurus	True
3880	Trigger pull is great - better than the Springfield Loaded and the Taurus PT1911's that I tried, but not "quite" as good as the Kimber Custom II I held at a local shop, but for $250 less, the Ruger is a much better deal.	Springfield	Taurus	True
3881	Even though it never came to fruition, SOCOM's star-crossed search for a new pistola paid solid benefits to us all...the Taurus OSS , the Springfield XD , the Glock 21 , the S&W M&P , the HK45 , the Beretta PX4 SD , as well as the FNP and P220, have all drastically upped the ante for .45	Springfield	Taurus	True
3882	Is a Ed Brown 1911 that much better than a stock Springfield/ Colt/ Ruger etc????	Springfield	Ruger	False
3883	You'd be better served going up to a Springfield, Ruger SR1911 or even a Sig 1911.	Springfield	Ruger	False
3884	I liked the sights better on the Ruger than the Springfield milspec.	Springfield	Ruger	False
3885	However, I prefer a little bit harder pull to the l-o-n-g, l-o-n-g pull of Ruger, S & W, and Springfield small guns.	Springfield	Ruger	False
3886	Is it really better than than a glock or m&p or even a springfield 1911 or ruger 1911 or a les baer.	Springfield	Ruger	False
3887	My favorites were: Sig Sauer P238 Glock 17 Ruger LCR (liked the way it felt a lot better than the S&W revolvers) Springfield Armory XD9	Springfield	Ruger	False
3888	There are excellent, used, pistols from Ruger, Glock, Smith and Wesson, Springfield Armory, and others, that will be a world better for you than what you are considering.	Springfield	Ruger	False
3889	That being said, just like the countless polymer "Service Pistols" (such as the M&P9, Glock 17, Ruger SR9, Springfield XD, etc) the more guns in the class the better the chance of each individual finding the gun that fits them the best.	Springfield	Ruger	False
3890	It's the new KalSig Eeew2 I'll be shooting (my trademark, hehe) with the recent Kal changes but, it still felt so much better than the Glocks (my dept's choice), Springfield, Ruger, etc. and the other smaller 9mm's I tried for my sissy like, smaller than average mitts.	Springfield	Ruger	False

3896	Much easier to turn over a Rossi or Taurus than a S&W or Ruger.	Taurus	Ruger	False
3897	Think resale, it would be easier to sell a Ruger than a Taurus.	Taurus	Ruger	False
3898	Charters look solid to me, nothing like a Ruger but a big step ahead of Taurus.	Taurus	Ruger	False
3899	I like stuff a tad nicer so id go Ruger or Taurus,but its not necessary either.	Taurus	Ruger	False

3901	You can only do better using the bigger calibers such as the 375 Ruger, 375 RUM, and Weatherby 378.	Ruger	Weatherby	False

6800	And though many may disagree with me, no-one conducts Mahler better than Bernstein (actually, thiss was the work that got me interested in the conductor).	May	Mahler	False
6801	Important though they may have been (in spots), not only did their Mahler performances not matter in the same way that Bernstein's did, the recorded evidence shows why: Bernstein was demonstrably superior in this music than they were, if by that we mean able to realize the composer's directives in a technically superior and idiomatically stylish way.	May	Mahler	False
6802	But it may also have something to do with the fact that in recent years tempi in Mahler have become slower as more and more conductors, in my opinion, choose to impose themselves and hang their own (real or trendily imagined) neuroses on music which is more than capable of expressing its own character without the conductor interfering.	May	Mahler	False
6803	In short, this may be another instance of the tendency for recordings of certain works (the Bruckner and Mahler symphonies coming particularly to mind) to become increasingly slower with the development of recording media that can accommodate longer units of time, rather than evidence of interpretive immaturity or idiosyncracy.
