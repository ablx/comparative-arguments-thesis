Todd-AO 35	Panavision	False

6686	S&W Auto, Blue, Mossberg Model 500A pump shotgun.	S&W	Mossberg	False
6687	Some of the decent ones seem to be the Beretta Neos, S&W 22A, Browning Buckmark and Ruger Mark III.	S&W	Browning	False
6688	Strangely enough, I seem to shoot better out that far with my S&W than I do with my Browning.	S&W	Browning	False
6689	If you want something inexpensive capable of decent accuracy, get a Ruger MKII or MKIII, a Browning Buckmark, a Beretta Neos, or a S&W 22A.	S&W	Browning	False
6690	They appreciate that they can shoot pistols like the Browning Hi-Power and the 1911 .45 and the Glock and the S&W 3913 better than most men realize.	S&W	Browning	False
6691	would do fine, the S&W .357 is ok but no CCW w/6" barrel, and the Browning A-Bolt is a great gun, but I think 7mm-08 would be a better caliber.	S&W	Browning	False
6692	pistol on this weekend gun show ( July 28-29), but now I still have some questions, If I compare with Ruger MK II 22/45, Browning Buckmark , S & W 22A and Walther P22, and concern about if which one is easy to be jammed when it eats cheap ammo, It is said Ruger, Browning are better then P22. ( I don't know about S & W 22a) .	S&W	Browning	False
6693	S&W pistol was in all ways a classic CZ-type tool, with all the particular features that have always made the CZ design a classic-most notably, of course, the solid full-length interface between slide and frame, wherein the frame encloses the slide (on all Browning-derived designs, it's the opposite).	S&W	Browning	False
6694	well after looking into the Sig , browning, GSG ,colt I think I'll stay with my first choice the S&W MP 22 other than it made in germany:facepalm: its railed for laser or lights, full sizes feel and better built slide	S&W	Browning	False
6695	The S&W 1911s depart from the pure John Browning formula by having external extractors, full length guide rods, and a firing pin safety system that indexes off the grip safety (similar to Kimber II series, preserving a better trigger pull).	S&W	Browning	False
6696	for example one man was caught with a browning buckmark pistol, a glock 9mm and an S&W .45. he had a large quantity of ammo for all of them and spent one day in jail which is ridiculous in the first place because it shouldnt be illegal but only one day for owning three illegal weapons and ammunition for all of them is even worse.
