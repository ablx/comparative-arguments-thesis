After all, Canon is much bigger enterprise than Nikon: They have far better engineers with PhDs.;A_GREATER_B
The F/4 line is what Canon has done better but Nikon is only a 70-200 away from completing that.;A_GREATER_B

The Shading graphs of Figure 7 indicate that the Nikon 14mm f/2.8 values are about three times (worse) than those of the Canon.;A_GREATER_B
Years ago, when I was trying to decide between similarly spec'ed Canon and Nikon cameras, I chose Canon because of the ergonomics.;A_GREATER_B
I did not go with a Nikon DSLR because I also wanted to use the camera for video and Canon seemed to be superior in that department.;A_GREATER_B
I had some old MF Nikkor lenses but surprisingly, with an adapter ring, they worked better in a Canon body than my friends Nikon DSLR.;A_GREATER_B
I can now see why every one buys the Canon for video.. Nikon are loosing heaps of customers because of it.. Really stupid move by them.;A_GREATER_B
Canon sold more cameras than nikon did world wide, but I understand it because canon is a huge company and mass produces more than nikon.;A_GREATER_B
Compare a Nikon raw with a Canon raw in ACR, Canon raw looks more detailed, better micro contrast, it just looks much better in every way.;A_GREATER_B
It is also a fact that Nikon has nevder been one of them, and that it has historically been better at dealing with Canon than Nikon raw files.;A_GREATER_B
The camera and lens combination is so much better than the Nikon equivalent and I can't wait to start adding other Canon lenses to my collection.;A_GREATER_B
Nikon lost their way with the D4/D800 because they wanted to catch up with Canon as far as video was concerned...but they forgot about the basics.;A_GREATER_B
Unless you want to trade 24-105 Canon for Nikon 24-120 F/4, which many people these days like over 24-70, because Nikon 24-70 is just too damn heavy.;A_GREATER_B
"The video on the canon is slightly better than the nikon; and it offers 1080p at 60fps which can be useful at delivering a more pleasant looking video.";A_GREATER_B
But if you want to see how much Canon rips you off for being better then Nikon, compare all Canon models and see what they improve and then charge you.;A_GREATER_B
There's also a point to be made on how well Fuji listens to customers while Nikon really takes the bottom rating on that front with Canon somewhat better.;A_GREATER_B
The Nikon does have a better fully articulated screen but compared to these other features on the Canon, in my opinion, you get a better camera in the SX40.;A_GREATER_B
Due to the RAW languages of each camera they process differently but I find Canon files pull back much better than the push up and Nikon is exactly the opposite.;A_GREATER_B
"DCI reviews the Canon EOS 450D/Digital Rebel XSi and writes; ""it has more resolution than the A200 and produces overall better quality images than the Nikon D60.";A_GREATER_B

If we see some background of high level professional Digital SLR camera than some times before canon had the better share than Nikon with its most appreciated model Canon EOS 5D.;A_GREATER_B
While I host a disdain for video becoming a prominent factor in still DSLR's, I don't think Nikon is ready to push aside still photography development for a better SLR like Canon obviously did.;A_GREATER_B
The 6D doesn't shoot quite as fast as the Nikon D600-it's about one frame per second slower-but the addition of Wi-Fi and GPS and superior image quality at high ISO settings give Canon the edge.;A_GREATER_B
johnparas11zenfoliodotcom : I am a nikon DSLR user, but I never liked the NIkon 18-55 kit lens it looks ugly.. this canon lens looks better, aesthetically of course.. we are not talking about the IQ output etc..;A_GREATER_B
I think you'd be better off buying a Canon like the 8800F, 8600F, 9950F etc for a lot less, then the extra £200+ you would have otherwise spent on the V700/750 put that towards a Nikon Coolscan for your slides etc.;A_GREATER_B
Featuring a magnesium-alloy body, 7-point autofocus system, and CMOS image sensor, the Canon 10D offers better performance and handling than its predecessor, the D60, and a more attractive price than the Nikon D100.;A_GREATER_B
"All astrophotography does digital subtraction of black point exposure, the difference here is Nikon offeres it ""in camera"" and the Canon is superior to the Nikon D80, etc. because it is a CMOS sensor instead of a CCD.";A_GREATER_B
I sold my Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 VR lens and picked up the Canon 70-200mm f/4L non-IS (I never used VR/IS on that lens anyways), like the Canon f/4 a whole lot better, and the difference in price paid for half of the 5D2 body!;A_GREATER_B
let the marketing games begin!  no question that 7D is still very succesful, so maybe Canon feels that a little kick in the pants and they can ride this train even longer to better position them to compete with the next Nikon offering.;A_GREATER_B
But I wonder if the folks running Nikon and Olympus web strategy know what Canon is doing so much better than them, and is predicted to do much better (slope of the line in the yellow area of the graph) than them during the holiday season.;A_GREATER_B
"I agree being able to rotate the shift axis independent of the tilt axis on the Canon lenses is a better design but saying ""The Canon PC-E lenses may be better as you can tilt and shift at the same time, with Nikon you can only tilt or shift.""";A_GREATER_B
I will only buy Canon gear , no more trying out any other brand , Nikon , on paper , is truly amaizng but in real life use Canon is better , BTW, I think Nikon manu system sucks and the D40X is a real silly camera what a shocking surprise is it?;A_GREATER_B
Thinking about the Canon SX160IS and Nikon L610 for the main options and on how much we can afford, want one with some decent video, I know that Canon seems to have a better optical picture quality on the point and shoots but Nikon seems to be OK also.;A_GREATER_B
@ Timbukto, i am a nikon user now but have been using canon till last summer and i must say the OOC jpegs looks way better from canon because of the higher default sharpening and contrast levels , and you ar not gaining much in that respect if you shoot raw .;A_GREATER_B
With new Nikon bodies being kind of disappointing (let's be honest - 1Dx looks much better than D4 and D800 is a camera that not only a fraction of Nikon users are waiting for right now), I guess many of us will face the moment when we'll think of switching to Canon.;A_GREATER_B
I wasn't in a position to buy a dSLR until mid-2009 anyway and now that Nikon have made their expensive cameras even more expensive (Forgive the credit crash) Canon are looking better (On price point and lens choice only) even after their price rise in December 2008.;A_GREATER_B
you might want to consider lens offered from each manufacture... there are pro's and cons to each... depending on what you are looking for, they 'can' cost more than the camera and impact the body used... canon lenses are thought to be better than the nikon/nikor's...;A_GREATER_B
These past years, we've seen a lot of photographers switching from Canon to Nikon... but I met two French photographers who recently moved from the Nikon D800 to the Canon EOS 5D Mark III because of a more versatile body and finally a better camera for most of their use.;A_GREATER_B
Even though Nikon was first to the party with the D90 , Canon has effectively staked out DSLR video as its private fiefdom, delivering camera after camera with superior video prowess, carving out a new market-not unexpected, since Canon makes video cameras, and Nikon, well, hasn't.;A_GREATER_B
The facts are that the D600 has been crippled as a serious video tool, and in that respect falls far behind the Canon lineup, which is a huge pity because I was looking forward to putting my Nikon glass on it and not having to buy a Canon camera (I don't like them as stills cameras).;A_GREATER_B
And I have to agree with most of what you are saying - I don't have a 5d3 for AF speed comparison - but for skin tones the canon is a lot better for me than the Nikon (I owned the D700 most recently but also shot with the D300 for a couple of years and have worked with the D3x at times).;A_GREATER_B
Assuming the noise is evenly distributed, or if you have a debanding NR tool, you might be able to gain another stop, and the gains might be a little better in terms of magnitude for a Canon...which starts out with more noise than a Nikon w/ Exmor, but the Nikon will still benefit from NR as well.;A_GREATER_B
pls nikon bring out a new pro camera for sports - tested the d3 against the mark IV - more pixels plus the crop means for pics shoot on the other side of the pitch: a much better quality for canon .... a d3x as fast and as low noisy like the d3 would help all the sportsshooters ... its a world cup year!;A_GREATER_B
If there is some measurement DxO is using that shows xxx lens on a D800 allows it to rate higher then they need to show that test/score - because of the scores they 'do' provide clearly show the Canon performing better... Just more Nikon stroking by DxO, nothing more than 'under the table compensation'...;A_GREATER_B
TLJester said:   First - thanks for the great responses !!! ... and so far no Nikon/Canon fist-fights have broken out I am tempted by the Canon as its newer, and the shots i have seen seem a bit punchier (and this is a pretty good deal!) on the other hand, i hear that the Nikon is better with low (higher?);A_GREATER_B
I'm a professional photographer and use canon gear - partly because I had 2 nikons (back in film days) and parts fell off those cameras so when it came time to 'go digital' I had the opportunity to try canon -and I've had only one issue and canon fixed it free even after the warranty expired, yet there are millions of happy nikon users out there.;A_GREATER_B

But then we'll need better security in Linux and OS X (both of which are apparently already far more secure than Windows, but do have vulnerabilities).;A_GREATER_B
As for the switch to Windows, many media professionals prefer OS X because the tools are (in their opinion) better / more productive in OS X than Windows.;A_GREATER_B
They love OS X because it's nice and shiny and 'just works' and hate Windows because it's far from shiny and is still fraught with problems left and right.;A_GREATER_B
The flaw is a lack of scaling, something Mac OS X wasn't immune to when Apple launched Retina Display MacBook Pros but it still works better than Windows 8.;A_GREATER_B

give it a year or so and you'll see everything running a lot faster on OS X. it's like, if MS decided to port Windows to PowerPC platform. of course no applications would run at native speed from the beginning because they wouldn't be simply compiled for that particular hardware.;A_GREATER_B

If the whole point of the appeal of Mac OS X is that Mac software is better than Windows software - or at least better in the eyes of one segment of the market - what possible good would it do Apple to help that software run on Windows, too?;A_GREATER_B?
Every so often, some of our academic colleagues wax lyrical about OS X apps and their rich functionality and/or ease of use for areas of content creation in which we're interested - podcasting, audio/video/image editing and upload, recording, etc. It'll be interesting to see whether Macs offer better or easier solutions than Windows for some kinds of content creation.;A_GREATER_B?
IMHO they do a better job with Nikon than Canon.;A_LESSER_B
And, the Nikon D800 IS MUCH BETTER than the Canon 5Dmark3.;A_LESSER_B
I choose Nikon because I prefer it more than the Canon features.;A_LESSER_B
Now the truth is that the Nikon D800 is better than the Canon 5Dmark3.;A_LESSER_B
Mythbusters - Canon 6D's AF is rebel-grade and certainly inferior to Nikon D6x0;A_LESSER_B
I switched to Nikon because I do not like at all the marketing strategy of Canon.;A_LESSER_B
In my opinion, Nikon cameras are better than Canon dslr cameras except D40 and D60.;A_LESSER_B
So far, I'd say the Nikon system worked better than the Canon AI Focus (I'm using 7D).;A_LESSER_B
Every time Nikon out performs Canon, it makes me feel a little better about my decision.;A_LESSER_B
IMHO Nikon lenses have always been better than Canon and good lenses are the bottom line.;A_LESSER_B
I love Nikon because the system feels better to me, but Canon makes a great product also.;A_LESSER_B
Canon is also getting better, but I would not say they are ahead of Nikon in terms of QA.;A_LESSER_B
THE NIKON D800 HAS ALREADY PROVED TO BE BETTER THAN CANON 5Dmk3 and even better than the Phase one.;A_LESSER_B
I choose the Nikon because it came with two lens for the same price as the Canon with just one lens.;A_LESSER_B
Even though I have a Canon 20D and love it, from all the reviews I've read, the Nikon D200 sounds better.;A_LESSER_B
After about 3 months of research, I chose the Nikon over the Canon because the features are much more user-friendly.;A_LESSER_B
Every nikon body is already better than its canon equivalent... where's the point in making a d900, d4 or whatever ?;A_LESSER_B
Every shot you take reflects the quality of the sensor, and - IMO - Sony/Nikon sensors are superior to Canon sensors.;A_LESSER_B
I've tried the Canon 18-200 IS, And the Nikon 18-200 VR Is a much better lens with better build quality, And faster AF!;A_LESSER_B
And for what it's worth I use Nikon because Canon does not have a fast full frame camera or an affordable FF with pro AF.;A_LESSER_B
"That said, Canon does make good stuff; I find Nikon to have the superior interface, making it easier to use all the features.";A_LESSER_B
Now, conceding that Nikon offers the better wides, with that extra $2,700 I just saved in buying Canon, I could buy a Nikon D700;A_LESSER_B
The aperture and shutter speed dials are usual Nikon fare, and is so much better than the way either Canon or Sony implements it.;A_LESSER_B
They picked Nikon over Canon (and other brands) mostly because they thought that Nikon provided better value in terms of ergonomics, AF,...;A_LESSER_B
I would consider some other brands, the nikon/sony/olympus 16mp+ sensors do noticeably better that the Canon for high iso and dynamic range.;A_LESSER_B
I quickly found that the Nikon fitted in my hand considerably better than the Canon (D50 vs 350D) so I went with Nikon for that single reason.;A_LESSER_B
And even though I went with Canon, I do think that Nikon makes better cameras (even with that said, I'm not switching camps any time soon though).;A_LESSER_B
To get a feel for just how much better the Nikon is is than the competition, have a look at this shootout between the Nikon D3300 and the Canon SL1 .;A_LESSER_B
Nikon is really a great system and about 25 yrs or so ago when it was the Nikon or Canon option I saw Nikon as a superior make vs Canon at that time.;A_LESSER_B
Nikon has better button layout and ability to easily change all camera settings is better then canon...tho I do like the big scroll wheel on the canon.;A_LESSER_B
And since Fuji cameras uses Nikon's F-mount, it rocks because Nikon users can buy both Fuji and Nikon bodies, which does have a slight edge over Canon.;A_LESSER_B
That said now that Canon has come out with their new system I'm sure Nikon will have a new AF system for the D5 that will be just as good if not better.;A_LESSER_B
Given that the Nikon 50 and 85 are equal or better in many ways than the Canon equivalent at f/1.4, your comment only applies IF you're shooting at f/1.2.;A_LESSER_B
Now the better and more civilized discussions are on the Nikon forum......they are the new innovators and do it for a better price like Canon of the past.;A_LESSER_B
Also if you look for top performer from all today's cameras it's a Nikon D4 which is 1/3-1/2 Ev better than Canon 1D X which is the best Canon for high ISO.;A_LESSER_B
Perfect specs, Canon will really have to go at great lengths with the new 5D to top the D800, and I know that at least in the AF section Nikon will be better.;A_LESSER_B
Frank C. : I dunno, I think the new Nikon is gonna smack this camera... is Canon still using their own sensors with the inferior DR? Aren't Canon owners fed up by now?;A_LESSER_B
This is why I switched to Nikon because canon kept changing their lens mounts and I kept having to buy new lenses every time I wanted to upgrade to a new generation camera!;A_LESSER_B
I picked up the Canon.. put it down and tried the Nikon.. picked up the Canon one more time simply because I couldn't believe the very cheap feel and then purchased the Nikon.;A_LESSER_B
I am astonished that so many fellow Canon users rush to flog whoever mentions that Nikon have been doing one single parameter of sensor design better than Canon for some years.;A_LESSER_B
I forgot to mention in my review that the Nikon zoom ring feels pretty good, the focusing ring not so, too loose for my taste, better then the Canon but not as good as the Sigma.;A_LESSER_B
The Canon 5d3 has much lower specs than the Nikon 610, and Sony a99, yet you degrade the Sony against it, even though its performance figures - your DxOMark figures, are superior.;A_LESSER_B
I also have a frind that shoots for a pro sports team and he just sold a couple hundred grand worth canon gear to move to the Nikon D3X for the sole purpose of better iso capabilities.;A_LESSER_B
I was torn between going Canon or Nikon, but in the end chose Nikon because that is what is use to shoot in 35mm film cameras, and I have a friend who is a true pro, and he shoot Nikon.;A_LESSER_B
I'm starting to do 24x60 inch prints quite a bit more regularly solely because I like them, they sell, and I can do them with visibly better quality using Nikon 800's than with my Canon gear.;A_LESSER_B
Paul Bohman - I'm glad that you pointed out that the Canon images don't support the kind of shadow detail that the Nikon images do, because I've begun to rely on the high dynamic range of my Nikons for a lot of my pictures.;A_LESSER_B
Then again, I switched from Nikon to Canon because I didn't like the D200's (and to a lesser extent, the D2H's) image quality and low-light performance...they both produced images that looked just a little cheap compared to the 5D.;A_LESSER_B
Canon might regret introducing the EF-S concept only if/when they lose large numbers of 60D sales because consumers realize that can upgrade to a Nikon D600 for about the same cost as upgrading to a 60D and they buy the Nikon instead.;A_LESSER_B
"i've visited every camera store in boston (at least 6 of them) in the last couple months and EVERY one of them recommended nikon dslr's over canon dslr's saying they were ""more reliable"", ""better picture quality"", and ""easier to use"".";A_LESSER_B
For moderate priced lenses, Nikons are often a bit faster in the same length (because they're in fact shorter for the same FOV), so the available darkness factor levels out a bit, and you may be shooting a Nikon at 800 against a Canon at 1600.;A_LESSER_B
i get that canon looks at sale fogures thats why they keep selling lenses that are sub par to what nikon offers in the same price range so people in the end want something better and buy a L as far as im concerned thats all canon thinks about.;A_LESSER_B
The sensors are up to Nikon quality, some Nikon use Sony sensors, but because of SLT technology the light hitting the senor is only 70% of the one gathered by the lens their high ISO is at par with Canon sensors that are lagging behind for years.;A_LESSER_B
"I used one a few days ago in Lijiang and it is a seriously nice camera... ergonomically it is outstanding -- far far far better than the latest Canon EOS-1D revision, which makes me glad to be a Nikon user... even if they do tend to lag a year behind Canon ;)";A_LESSER_B
While I shoot more video than stills for my clients (about 55/45 video skew) I still need to be concerned with still image quality....and Nikon is simply better than Sony, Canon or Panasonic for stills....especially shooting in RAW and where dynamic range is important.;A_LESSER_B
There is no harm in using FX lenses on DX bodies and if 18-200 DX and 70-300 VR can't satisfy you then good luck with the 100-400 :) ,grass always looks greener on the other side :) I've used both, in film ,it doesn't matter but Nikon in digital is far better than Canon.;A_LESSER_B
"I hung in there with Nikon(because of the Nikkor glass that I already owned and my Nikon flash gear, which is light years ahead of Canon's), saying to myself: ""don't jump to Canon, the day is coming when Nikon will make THE camera that you're waiting for.....and here it is!";A_LESSER_B
To be honest I simply envy people who already have good Nikon lens and Nikon FF, they now have opportunity to expand a set with a perfect studio camera, while canon owners, like me, have an opportunity to have better or good AF while other parameters remain almost unchanged.;A_LESSER_B
"And, ok, maybe saying Canon is ""really bad"" was a little too much, but still, I don't understand why so many people buy Canon when Nikon and Pentax are better, and Pentax camera's are much cheaper than Canon when we look at all the extra functions they contain compared to Canon.";A_LESSER_B
A lot? Well, realistically there's just the Nikon d600/d610 which is of course the better overall camera, but Canon knows from experience that 100-200€ won't make people jump ship - and those who want a ff and don't care about af will pay some $$$ more than the 70d w/o a second thought.;A_LESSER_B
"Camera ..DSLR with video ...Canon 600D or 60D or Nikon 5100 ..all are HD capable ..Nikon focusing slightly is better if the subject is moving when you zoom ( but the lenses are more specific than the canons ) ..all take mics..you'll need ""off camera"" mics as the noise of the built in ones is intrusive...";A_LESSER_B
"The battery life is on the nikon is better; especially if you record more video than the canon - After 150 photos and a number of videos and time-lapse images in a day the battery is showing as having a third of its life left; I carry a spare for the Canon as taking video definitely dents the battery life.";A_LESSER_B
Windows 7 on my v 2,1 MBA is by far better than OS X on my MBA.;A_LESSER_B

Windows is better than OS X as a post-production operating system.;A_LESSER_B
Windows 8 adoption: Worse than Vista, better than OS X Mountain Lion;A_LESSER_B

Flash performance on Windows is an order of magnitude better than on OS X.;A_LESSER_B

When Microsoft announced Windows 7, I actually thought it looked better than OS X (I use OS X).;A_LESSER_B

I will simply say : no, people will only see os X is not better than windows and will simply reject it.;A_LESSER_B
Windows seems to do much better at wireless auto settings than OS X, at least that has been my experience.;A_LESSER_B
But OS X integration is not much better than running the Windows binary in Wine ... -  iolsmit Oct 4 '12 at 0:27;A_LESSER_B
By Matthew Broersma, Techworld Windows is more secure than you think, and Mac OS X is worse than you ever imagined.;A_LESSER_B
For instance C# is a much bigger success than Objective C because Windows XP is a much bigger success than Mac OS X.;A_LESSER_B
And because Apple hasn't allowed it access to key pathways in Mac OS X , Flash is much slower on the Mac than it is on Windows.;A_LESSER_B
(I'll add that Firefox, in my opinion, works better, or at least fits in better, on Windows and on Linux than it does on Mac OS X.);A_LESSER_B
Life is still much better for a developer on Windows than on Mac OS X - no matter what one might think of the usability, etc. of Windows.;A_LESSER_B
"Certain aspects of Apple's Mac OS X are ""complete and utter crap"" and ""worse than Windows"", according to Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds.";A_LESSER_B
I suspect this is due to better support for Roaming Profiles in our environment for Windows, so I'm trying to improve that a bit for the OS X user.;A_LESSER_B
I don't want to indicate that whatever the majority says is always correct - the majority of people think any version of Windows is better than OS X or Linux.;A_LESSER_B
If this news sounds familiar, it's because last month, rival measurement firm NetMarketShare found that Windows 8 market share had cruised past OS X in August .;A_LESSER_B
I wouldn't say OS X is better than Windows 7 (I prefer OS X but that's because I'm UNIX biased), but it's obvious that Windows 7 has a lot more effort put into it.;A_LESSER_B
Windows 7 is arguably better than Apple OS X and people like it, now they are going to be faced with a new UI and years of Microsoft fiddling about to get it right.;A_LESSER_B
If you can bypass ASLR in Windows as was done, it doesn't seem as though full ASLR (as Windows advocates say) is much better than the partial ASLR that Mac OS X has.;A_LESSER_B
I have to run the Windows version of Ventrilo client because the Ventrilo server I'm using is set to use the GSM codec, which the OS X Ventrilo client doesn't support.;A_LESSER_B
Leading security expert Dino Dai Zovi is telling Mac fans the news they don't want to hear - that Windows Vista is better than the current version of Mac OS X from a security standpoint.;A_LESSER_B
There is very far less assistive technology software available for Mac OS X than for Windows, partly because far fewer people use Mac computers and partly because the built-in accessibility meets more people's needs.;A_LESSER_B
for the opengl part, well, opengl performance on os x has always sucked and nvidias opengl drivers on windows/linux/... are far superior (including shader compiler optimizations at which apple should actually be good at ...).;A_LESSER_B
Window management, in terms of on-screen placement, is one of the Mac's weakest areas, and while OS X Lion's full-screen mode will be fine for focussing on a single task, Windows 7 does a lot better when it comes to multiple applications.;A_LESSER_B
A recent column by Robert Cringely points to the possibility of Mac systems running the most secure Windows Vista installations, while Microsoft engineers made statements suggesting that Vista will be superior to Mac OS X, causing current Mac users to abandon Apple's OS.;A_LESSER_B
But that aside, Windows 10 is still easier to navigate than Mac OS X and Windows 8, has better access to files than in Android, and is faster, more flexible and more capable than Windows XP and the Home and Enterprise editions of Windows 7. Overall, it's the best OS I've ever used.;A_LESSER_B
When a job last year required me to work on Windows 7 aihcmnes I was dreading it but after getting used to the differences I found it to be every bit as good as OS X and in some aspects better (I find task bar is cleaner and easier than the dock, and dual monitor work with a Cintiq is much much easier than on a Mac in fact in some ways it's got worse with Lion.;A_LESSER_B

For this reason alone, Python is clearly better than Ruby or Perl.;A_LESSER_B
The only reason Python is used over Ruby, is because of libraries...;A_LESSER_B
Migration from python to ruby is problematic because ruby lacks certain features.;A_LESSER_B
One of the reasons I chose Python over Ruby is because it isn't a TIMTOWTDI language.;A_LESSER_B
But I preferred Python over Ruby, because it had more libraries and seemed to be better documented.;A_LESSER_B
Python use in scientific programming language but ruby not use because python provide large library.;A_LESSER_B

Hi Aaron, I gave up on Ruby for now precisely because it doesn't support Unicode natively while Python does, or so I thought...;A_LESSER_B
Some will say Python is better for GUI apps as it compiles more, and is a tad faster, and it's fairly similar to Ruby on the surface.;A_LESSER_B
I usually recommend Python over Ruby, as I prefer it, but in this case it may be better, due to everything inherently being an object.;A_LESSER_B
I love the language but I'm considering getting better at python just because ruby is so slow I feel bad using it for anything serious.;A_LESSER_B
I love Ruby, more than I love Python (which I do love...) - but I feel Python is a better choice for teaching/learning as a first language.;A_LESSER_B
I'm not totally convinced the debugging tools for Perl, Python or PHP are substantially better than Ruby, even if they are slightly better.;A_LESSER_B
(In other words, in my opinion, it's better to use Python than something else you're not already using, like Ruby or some other interpreted language).;A_LESSER_B
Python unicode support has always seemed trivial to me, and much better than the other languages I've worked with (c, php, perl, ruby, javascript, actionscript).;A_LESSER_B
"As much as I love Ruby, I might recommend Python over Ruby to a total beginner because of Python's 'there's one best way to do something and this is it' philosophy.

I thought I'd send this out to Nitro because I've seen the plethora of frameworks in the Python world and ... This kind of gateway structure for Ruby would be lovely.;A_LESSER_B
Now that Python has a huge bucket of competing solutions, some arguably superior, especially in ORMs, the draw of Ruby vs Python seems to have been drastically reduced.;A_LESSER_B
In addition the comparison on multi-core machines is also flawed because Ruby code uses only one CPU whereas Python uses all four due to use of multiprocessing library.;A_LESSER_B
I find Ruby better suited for interactive usage (irb), but like wise that Python has considerably better documentation on how to use stuff - that's why I prefer Python.;A_LESSER_B
While much used bindings e.g. to Databases are of good quality I found niche libs to be better supported in Python even if for the same library there is also a Ruby binding.;A_LESSER_B
"Later they have patched some holes, but some of the original more ""relaxed"" nature of Python shows still (Ruby is worse than Python regarding large multiprogrammer programs).";A_LESSER_B
I kind of like the Python language better and it seems to be more full-featured than Ruby for statistical, scientific and networking (let me know if you think this is wrong).;A_LESSER_B
Python has been around significantly longer than Ruby, & with Google's embrace of the language, Python's documentation has gotten noticeably better during the last few years.;A_LESSER_B

It shows in their superior NEX line and now they are already two steps ahead of Canon and Nikon on the mirrorless cameras.
I'm gonna test one myself - maybe switch to Canon (Nikon user here) if it's really something better than my Nikon kit lens
Canon/Nikon) I believe you won't find better than Canon's MP-E 65mm f/2.8 lens, which ranges from 1:1 to 5:1 magnification.
I have not used a lens of any focal length (Canon, Nikon, Zeiss, ...) that delivered better/sharper image quality at f/1.4.
I like Nikon because the shutter sounds much more manly than the Canon, which is, by all practical accounts, a bit effete.";NO_COMP
I told you Nikon , i wan't to send you my money, but for 3k this canon set looks a better, and diferent add to my photo bag.;NO_COMP
Something like a Nikon D90 (mid range)/ Canon Digital Rebel XTi or Nikon D40 (entry level) would be better idea I would say.;NO_COMP
Sara switched from Nikon to Canon a while back and has stuck with them because of her considerable investment in Canon lenses.;NO_COMP
Even resurrecting an old brand like Contax would be better than putting Canon/Nikon on the camera (Kyocera killed it in 2002).;NO_COMP
Some say that about the 16 Mpix Canon 1Ds MII, fewer say it about the 12 Mpix Nikon D2x because the sensor is so much smaller.;NO_COMP
I still think that Pentax is better choice then Canon 550D or Nikon D3100 or D5100, and this is why I'm asking for your advice.;NO_COMP
Overall the DSLR-A700's performance trails both the Nikon D300 and Canon EOS 40D although does seem better than the Olympus E-3.;NO_COMP
I've never even held a Canon to my knowledge, so I can't and won't compare because I'm comfortable and know what Nikon produces.;NO_COMP
So if it's better than the Canon 20D, and the Canon 5D isn't really a direct competitor, what is the Nikon D200's closest rival?;NO_COMP
If we wanted big we would get a Nikon or Canon for roughly half the price with image quality better or at least as good as m4/3.;NO_COMP
I would lean back towards Nikon if their low light performance was better than Canon, even if it meant slightly less resolution.;NO_COMP
Too bad the 10mm Switar does not cover, as it is superior, likely, to any lens Canon or Nikon makes in acuity and image quality.;NO_COMP
I chose Canon five years ago mainly because it seemed the obvious leader in DSLR, even though I had always wanted to own a Nikon.;NO_COMP
I dont want to switch to Nikon because I have a lot of canon lenses (50mm 1.8, 18-200mm and my ultimate favorite the 24-70mm 2.8).;NO_COMP
Similarly to the Canon, the Nikon 70-200mm f2.8 is sharper than the Sigma, also offering better results for CA and corner shading.;NO_COMP
If Nikon is using better sensor technology (vis-a-vis Sony), then it could take another generation of camera for Canon to catch up.;NO_COMP
Canon is better off doing that from a marketing perspective than Nikon would be taking the D800 body and throwing in a 22 mp sensor.;NO_COMP
It generates higher MTFs than 21-24 Mpix full frames from Canon, Nikon or Sony because its constructors dispensed with an AA filter.;NO_COMP
Either complacency got the better of Canon engineers or perhaps their Nikon counterparts are just more hungry to regain the top spot.;NO_COMP
I'll listen to arguments that the Canon 5D3 is as good as the Nikon D800, but I'm having a hard time thinking that it's $500 better .;NO_COMP
I can't speak for Nikon because I've never handled one myself, but many photographers prefer the dynamic range from Nikon than Canon.;NO_COMP
In some ways this might harm Nikon (already bleeding cash, and already trying to convince people to switch systems) worse than Canon.;NO_COMP
While I prefer Nikon for DSLRs I like Canon for point and shoots and but I have an LX3 because it fits my needs better as a PS camera.;NO_COMP
Fuji has to be proactive because they currently don't have a system, unlike Canon and Nikon who have well established, mature systems.;NO_COMP
I think a 1500$ FF is possible nowadays and I wish those nikon D600 rumours are true, because canon will have to do something about it;NO_COMP
For now, an entry level Canon or Nikon DSLR is a better bet, coming in with humongous lens and accessory systems and lower price tags.;NO_COMP
The X1 Pro had better be top notch, on par with something Canon or Nikon would produce in terms of components and attention to detail.;NO_COMP
It would cost the same to go with a brand new D800 and their Nikon 600mm as only the Canon lens because of the big difference in cost.;NO_COMP
"People are saying, ""Dude, Nikon better come out with higher megapixel camera, man, so like, they can be the leader of Canon and Kodak.""";NO_COMP
Here you clearly see WHY Nikon beats everyone else and why Canon is better than Sony plus why Nikon has pulled away from everyone else.;NO_COMP
Anyone with an existing investment in either Canon or Nikon lenses would probably be better off sticking to their chosen camera system.;NO_COMP
I don't want to upgrade to a better Canon camera because I plan to purchase a Nikon, and I probably won't be able to sell my equipment.;NO_COMP
i started this post because I have to laugh when I read people complain about the some of the newer released cameras from canon or nikon.;NO_COMP
Having owned all of the Nikon and Canon super-telly lenses, I would rate this a tie with the Canon 300mm IS II, and better than the rest.;NO_COMP
I can't get a wholesale price from Nikon or Canon - but Amazon can, so I'll buy from them because they can usually get me the best price.;NO_COMP
The Canon S110 is a quality camera, but with a price tag of $399, other camera models like the Nikon P330 or Canon G15 are a better value.;NO_COMP
I'm still going to get a Nikon or Canon because of the price and familiarity, but for anyone considering this camera, it seemed very nice.;NO_COMP
And those were found superior by numerous Nikon and Canon photographers, clearly superior to what they had available for their own cameras.;NO_COMP
Your mileage may vary but I have yet to hear of wholesale failures in the Sony line that are any worse than Fuji, Oly, Panny, Canon, Nikon.;NO_COMP
The difference is that someone shooting Canon, Sony or Nikon is not hostile to the idea because their favorite brand offers multiple sizes.;NO_COMP
I would love to hear more about what makes the Canon better at portraits and landscapes, and the Nikon better at sports and photojournalism.;NO_COMP
I prefer Canon and Nikon white balance in better light as well, but the difference isn't as stark, and a lot of that is personal preference.;NO_COMP
Sony would have to have radically better AF performance to make on-sensor PD the attraction that gets the attention of the Canon/Nikon users.;NO_COMP
A real SLR like the Nikon D70 or Canon Digital Rebel offers far better image quality due to the larger image sensor and far faster operation.;NO_COMP
Nikon, Canon and Pentax all have much better camera technology than Leica (which still makes great lenses but not for the price they charge!).;NO_COMP
"I did go back and read the part about dynamic range, but his conclusion still screams ""canon fanboy because i dont know how to operate a Nikon""";NO_COMP
I am probably going to shoot a hybrid of Nikon and Canon this year, because both have some fantastic new technologies with different strengths.;NO_COMP
Canon and Nikon have adopted 24mm as the standard wide angle on their professional zooms because it makes a significant difference in practice.;NO_COMP
"Canon is more ""risky"" when taking photos let me say and sometimes it leads me to frustration, but final result could be better than with Nikon.";NO_COMP
Nikon D7000 or Canon 60D), but the full frame ones are often still just a little bit better in areas like ruggedness, AF speed, FPS, and noise.;NO_COMP
I wonder if the Nikon camp complains about AF & ISO or FPS?  Canon will eventually have better sensors, and Nikon will eventually have better AF.;NO_COMP
"So what is it about the Nikon D70 or D80 (both supposedly better than what I'm using now) or a pro Canon camera that makes them ""better"" cameras?";NO_COMP
I am not sure if they were hand picked, but they are supposed to be better performers than the run of the mill lens in the Nikon or Canon mounts.;NO_COMP
It may be more expensive but the resale value is higher because it appeals to both Canon and Nikon owners plus there is no messy glue on the mount.;NO_COMP
The Nikon D800 video quality is nothing short of stunning for its price point (better than the Canon 5D MKII) as yet Ive not shot with the 5D MKIII;NO_COMP
Nikon has great bodies and i really considered the Nikon system but i choosed the Canon mainly because of this lens, the 70-200 F4 and the MP-E 65.;NO_COMP
It feels better than the Nikon/Canon of the world since Zeiss put so much efforts into it and almost totally sacrificed the convenience side of it.;NO_COMP
There's no better computer for photo editing than the Mac, which is supported by cameras from Canon, Kodak, Nikon, Konica Minolta, Sony and others.;NO_COMP
The Canon 500D is the most expensive of the trio because Canon and Nikon avoid competing head-to-head by interleaving price and features in models.;NO_COMP
If you are likely to upgrade to higher pro-sport level performance equipment or full frame cameras, then Canon and Nikon are probably better choice.;NO_COMP
Perhaps my memory is worse than I thought, but, it doesn't seem all that long ago that Rita posted a reference to a pro-Canon shooter who went Nikon.;NO_COMP
The main players Canon and Nikon aren't much better I have no objection to micro subscriptions and would gladly pay for material I know I would enjoy.;NO_COMP
It's a little worse on the wide end than either the Canon or Nikon offerings (very bad corners and edges), and the color performance is okay but flat.;NO_COMP
In fact everyone who shoots Canon is switching to Nikon so you better get started selling your stuff if you don't want to get trampled in the stampede.;NO_COMP
However, overall I have real difficulty in understanding why some people insist that my Canon is better than your Nikon, just for the sake of argument.;NO_COMP
"I rated it a 10 on all counts because the ""competition"" is other kit lenses I've used from Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, and Sony...so keep that in context.";NO_COMP
I went through a similar situation and I narrowed it down to Nikon, Canon FD, and Olympus because they are quality and the lenses are readily available.;NO_COMP
Yes, the D70 viewfinder is a disappointment to Nikon users that are used to Nikon's film cameras, but that doesn't make the Canon viewfinders any better.;NO_COMP
All in all its a feature rich camera that is a bit on the expensive side with poor build quality, I think a Nikon or Canon is better quality and value ...;NO_COMP
I've never really been a Canon fan mainly because my very first SLR way back in the olden times (late '70s/early '80s) was a Nikon and I've had lots since;NO_COMP
And to top that, unlike Nikon or Canon, Fuji is loyal enough to their customer base that their cameras actually get better over time with firmware updates!;NO_COMP
"If 22MP makes the 5D MkIII a crap camera, then all the pros must be fools because both Canon and Nikon are trying to sell them cameras with ""only"" 16-18MP.";NO_COMP
In our local camera shop, I've been able to get M42s rather cheap because it's the Nikon, Canon FD, and Pentax K-mount lenses that fetch the higher prices.;NO_COMP
( another Canon's kingdom at stake) If a low price nikon FF camera comes to stage completing that 36 mp sensor..., canon must react, the sooner the better.;NO_COMP
Raw images (after conversion to TIFF) have a better signal-to-noise ratio than even the Nikon D800, and almost match the Nikon D4 and Canon EOS 5D Mark III.;NO_COMP
"I shall be highly obliged if you do not resort to saying that ""I have read Nikon can do better"" after showing us a photograph taken by your Canon gear alone.";NO_COMP
One thing I don't think you mentioned in this series is that because Canon has a physically wider mount than Nikon, with an adapter you can use Nikon lenses.;NO_COMP
While Canon/Nikon might have a tad better lens system at the high end, unless you can afford 1000+ for each lens, the Minolta will more then suit your needs.;NO_COMP
It took Canon and Nikon decades to build up that many lenses and the likes of Olympus, Panasonic and Sony are not going to do that any faster, or any better.;NO_COMP
If Sony had any real system lenses for the A7 series, a little better AF, and better EVF, we could be sitting here asking each other who Nikon and Canon are.;NO_COMP
This was how the Austin Gypsy was found to be a better buy than a Land Rover, and how (as I recall) Pentax came out as the top SLR, trouncing Nikon and Canon.;NO_COMP
My opinions I love Nikon and am not bragging to anyone who better or what so ever!!!! I'm just being a humble person if someone ask me how to work with Canon.;NO_COMP
The Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro might not be that much better than for example the Canon EOS 20D or the Nikon D100 but it features its own special characteristics.;NO_COMP
However both Nikon and Canon have cheap 50mm prime lenses (£80) that will produce photos better than what your compact can even on an older cheap 2nd hand body.;NO_COMP
I'm sure Chuck that with your errmm... field testing of the Nikon D3x that there's lots to like about the competition and that Canon had better lift their game.;NO_COMP
Why the rumored D800 delay IS nikon and NR's fault is because they turn civilized people to think irrationally and make impulsive moves like switching to Canon.;NO_COMP
Me: People who aren't buying Nikon because of the 5D Me: Canon 5D owners Me: So wedding photography will be the big one Me: I wonder what the frame rate will be?;NO_COMP
Yes, Nikon has better dynamic range at ISO 100, but above ISO 1000, where it really starts to matter, Canon actually takes over (only slightly, but consistently.);NO_COMP
While you could probably do better with a similarly classed Canon or Nikon for low light or sports shooting situations, no current DSLR is better as an all rounder.;NO_COMP
Zoom H4n: Better DSLR Audio Solution for HD Video One of the hottest trends in video production is to use DSLR cameras such as the Canon 5D and 7D or the Nikon D90.;NO_COMP
Though buying used telephoto lenses like these may not be everyone's thing, all of the Minolta's are discontinued so if thats the case you're better off with Canon/Nikon.;NO_COMP
I've been agonising over a better digital SLR for some time and generally been disappointed at the look and feel of a number of Canon, Nikon and Lumix cameras I've tried.;NO_COMP
The 'foursixtyfive' has a movable flash head in both axes which is one of the features where it's better than the entry level modes from Canon (270EX) and Nikon (SB-400).;NO_COMP
And I have no doubt the new Panasonic will be the equal, if not superior, to the Canon or Nikon offerings in regards to IQ, and obviously far superior in regards to reach.;NO_COMP
Canon, Olympus, Nikon and the rest had better start adding mobile phone capabilities to their cameras or else Nokia and Sony-Ericsson will take over the digital photo world.;NO_COMP
Sony/Pentax/Olympus are known to have poorer high ISO than Canon and Nikon, but ISO 800 on my A300 was as good or better than ISO 800 film, unless you really pulled some tricks.;NO_COMP
The size and weight are not due to being built to a higher quality standard - there is no evidence to suggest that they are any better built than the Nikon/Canon etc. f/2.8 zooms.;NO_COMP
Canon and Nikon are still the most popular brands but I usually recommend Sony to first time DSLR buyers now because I think the camera features are better - especially for video.;NO_COMP
The only reason to give piles of money to Leica is its lenses (which is arguably the best optically for 35mm photography), and IMO Canon or Nikon sensors are better than M9 sensors.;NO_COMP
Also, I would look at the Nikon D2X because it is in a similar price range and is said to be an excellent camera - unless of course you are already heavily invested in Canon lenses.;NO_COMP
In the past Nikon bashing was far more limited because all the couch critics with specs-based arguments were using Canon and were wrecking havoc among each others on 'the other side';NO_COMP
"in terms of the price, i don't believe it will be very high by the time the new FF fuji comes out - only because nikon/canon are already offering ""consumer"" FF which are around $2100.";NO_COMP
That is to say, certain 3rd party (Sigma, Tamron, Tokina etc.) lenses are superior in optical quality to their Nikon/Canon equivalents, and in other cases, the main manufacturers win out.;NO_COMP
Of course it would be much better if Canon was bright enough to provide several of these (C1, C2, C3, etc.) for the other positions on the dial, but oh well, Nikon provides none of these.;NO_COMP
Our analysis shows that the Olympus SZ-14 has better signal to noise ratio results than the Canon IXUS125 HS at all but ISO 80, and the Nikon Coolpix S8200 at all sensitivities but ISO 1600.;NO_COMP
From what I can tell it seems damn hard, because if you've ever used Nikon Capture or tried to tether with Canon software you realize even companies with huge resources miss the mark sometimes.;NO_COMP
The kit lenses of both Nikon and Canon will give you that range, at probably a bit better quality since cheap older film lenses tend to show their short comings on digital bodies in a major way.;NO_COMP
Multi mode exposure, spot and matrix metering, integrated motors, autofocus, DX coding, the F3 had none of that, but it outlived two or three generations of newer-better-faster pro bodies from Nikon or Canon.;NO_COMP
In the case of Canon and Nikon, they've worked decades to fine-tune their image processing algorithms, transfer functions and color matrices to get images that simply look better, to me, than I get from this Sony.;NO_COMP
While it's not any worse than equivalent lenses such as the Canon or Nikon 18-200mm zooms away from the center it struggles to deliver the resolution that the GH1's Live-MOS sensor would theoretically be capable of.;NO_COMP
When you're in control of the light, if you need different lenses or have at least a few moments to get the camera dialed-in for each shot, the 5D Mark III (or other Nikon or Canon DSLR) ultimately will create better results.;NO_COMP
The things always happend again, what will you goin to do if next year canon decide to maintain theirs current products and the new 2011 nikon line (looks that is not a rumor) are better than canaon products, you will cahange again?;NO_COMP
If you're not sold on the D3300, you could look to other options like the Nikon D5300 for the next step up, the Pentax K-50 for weather sealing and better controls, or the Canon SL1 if you just don't want to buy into a Nikon system.;NO_COMP
Since the LEICA M9 makes such horrible JPGs and has such horrible auto WB and no blue/amber fine tuning, the JPGs out of the X100 are superior to the M9's JPGs, but the Canon S95 and Nikon D5100 also make far better JPGs than the M9.;NO_COMP
Canon and Nikon 'seem' to release more regularly because they have more FF models in totality, but really the D700 and 5D MkII were released about the same time as the A900, the A99 a few months after the Canon 5D III and Nikon D800.;NO_COMP
The lenses will probably make more of a difference - a better lens on a Canon will make better images than an inferior lens on a Nikon (and vice versa) - so you should also consider which company makes better lenses for your purposes.;NO_COMP
"In a way this holds true for even the dslrs because once Canon and Nikon opened the door to the same sensor in a body that costs 1/2 of the ""professional"" version many people will go to the lower priced option, if the sensor is the same.";NO_COMP
You can read about it here So why would a flash trigger be Nikon or Canon specific you ask? That's because it reads and uses the camera's TTL codes and each manufacturer uses slightly different pins on the hotshoe to transmit those codes.;NO_COMP
It's worth mentioning that the record result of 50 lpmm was something we were expecting up to a point because the Olympus E-510, having 10 Mpix on a small 4:3 sensor, is much more densely pixel-packed than e.g. a Nikon D200 or a Canon 20D.;NO_COMP
Ergonomics, esthetics... To some, the Nikon fits better in the hand, to others the Canon White L lenses are sexy looking... :p Some photographers still prefer film than digital so... we can't really fight against what artists prefer to work with.;NO_COMP
"Their roadmap (PDF file) doesn't promise any more ""D FA"" lenses but I'm not sure whether that's because there are already enough, together with the ""FA"" lenses or whether they have decided to abandon the full-frame market to Canon, Nikon and Sony.";NO_COMP
I hope Nikon design all they're sensors in future cameras and decide against the 14 MP sony because sony sensors have a difficult time with 14 bits and future technology's such as video are not competitive with sony sensors when compared to Canon.;NO_COMP
IF Nikon wants to strike back with a whatever replacement they want to name it they need to bring out a camera that has a better video compression from Canon with loads of other possibilities, one of them being full frame as well as DX crop factor.;NO_COMP
Right now what's hindering Nikon is their legacy and prime lenses price, while some may argue they perform better than Canon lenses in reality they don't perform much better than the price difference you see which in turn makes things hard for Nikon.;NO_COMP
then a pocket olympus but when I wanted a real DSLR I looked at Pentax, Sony, Nikon and Canon - for the money the Canon 450D has better resolution, the Sony would have been my choice were it not for the small place they have in the market / aftermarket;NO_COMP
Thats almost never the case, pro line doesn't mean better iq a pro camera have different feature, take a look at canon or Nikon you will see that the best performer (iq) cameras are the d800e and 5dm3, and those are NOT pro line for those manufacturer,;NO_COMP
For example, in the case of the Canon, the sensor is what is limiting the numbers compared to the Nikon, however, when stopped down to F4 the number improves greatly for Canon, if the Lens' was better from the start, why wasn't it on more equal footing?;NO_COMP
If Nikon has a supply issue and Canon has tipped their hand, this allows Nikon to possibly re-think some specs (like is 36 necessary, perhaps 21 or 18 or 25 would be fine) and enable a better price point, or better margins, more reliability, better ISO etc..;NO_COMP
The advantages of the Nikon over the Canon are - slightly smaller and lighter, HDR, better resolution and slightly better sharpness, better zoom, and the advantages of the Canon over the Nikon are - better low light behaviour, slightly faster, better battery.;NO_COMP
That is not nikon way in most of the cases The statement Canon is a Camera made for Enginners is true because sometime they have leading technoilogies but Nikon is a camera made for Photographer because nikon have a solution for the peoples who love take pictures.;NO_COMP
For 30k you can take your photography a step further just with a parabolic umbrella, or HMI's or better post production and by the time the S2 is on the shelf does anyone really believe that Canon and Nikon won't have something out there in the 30mpx area as well.;NO_COMP
New features include the addition of a tethered shooting mode for some Nikon and Canon cameras, enhancements for a better workflow and faster image loading, and a new luminance noise reduction function to complement the already existing color noise reduction feature.;NO_COMP
"The cropped lenses from Nikon and Canon work really well on the APS sensor cameras because the sensor is only seeing the ""sweet spot"" center of the lens, plus the fisheye distortion is minimized near the center too so we have a very wide, low light lens in this case.";NO_COMP
"In very general terms, Canon is probably superior to Nikon in marketing, and in offering a wide feature set for a low price; on the other hand, most consider that Nikon cameras have somewhat better lenses, and have better ergonomics: they just feel better in the hand.";NO_COMP
Long time photographers with a collection of lenses and perhaps a fondness for manual focus will find the Sony A7 and A7R incredibly versatile cameras because you can use a variety of lenses including Leica M, Canon and Nikon full frame lenses with these two Sony cameras.;NO_COMP
However what you have written concerning highlight recovery/shadow lifting in post pretty much reminds me of my experience with the Pentax 645D and it would require further testing to demonstrate that this - at least at base ISO - is superior over a Nikon D8X0 or Canon 5DS/R.;NO_COMP
If, on the other hand, you really need to flow seamlessly from stills to video, then you should say goodbye to both Canon and Nikon and look at the Panasonic GH2, which matches the D5100 for shooting stills (except its flash is a bit tempermental), but is way better for video.;NO_COMP
This camera replaces the Fuji S2 I've been using for the past 2 years and although the S2's are wonderful cameras (much better than the Nikon digitals that are out IMHO), I'd have to give this camera a oneup on the S2 for build quality and a few other Canon specific functions.;NO_COMP
This seems to be unavoidable with 50mm lenses on FF Canon cameras (and I expect elsewhere too - it was pretty bad on the Pentax 50mm 1.4 I used to own (aps-c, where it should be much less of a problem), while the Nikon 1.8 I tried a few months ago on a FF Nikon was much worse).;NO_COMP
This is BAD for everyone because I'm finding left and right that a great many people are doing this and once Canon has lost their base, which they will, Nikon can leave prices just where they are..... Sony is going to have a rough time, not many have the pocket for a Med Format.;NO_COMP
Actually I hope Samyang itself won't be defeating one of the main purposes of a TS lens... so far they've been making very sharp lenses that are just as good as and sometimes better than Canon, Nikon, Zeiss, etc. lenses but one thing they've been bad at is controlling distortion.;NO_COMP
Scenario 2 : I have a great camera, but even when shooting with ISO 100 (Canon etc.) or 200 (Nikon), the image noise is visible because I only want to use a very small part of the tonal range (e.g. in foggy situations) and therefore the small amount of noise is heavily amplified.;NO_COMP
The default I posted is 'film standard' ... I've processed literally thousands of images with this converter and rarely found nature or wildlife shots that looked better with the flatter settings, so that's probably why Nikon and Canon (and Capture One) bias the settings that way.;NO_COMP
The only stumbling block is that £549 would also buy such newcomers a decent entry level DSLR, such as a Nikon D5100 or Canon EOS 1100D , with standard 18-55mm zoom and arguably better image quality - that's if the GF3's much smaller form factor isn't the over-riding consideration.;NO_COMP
I'm just making a comment on how Nikon has an issue with the production of some D600 cameras and that they need to fix it because it does discourage some people in buying a D600, especially when some true Canon trolls make it such a huge issue, and that is something that will not cease.;NO_COMP
i saw join develop 4K sensor on image sensor world site by Pany and others factory, on video feature i don 't think Oly will get better because they ignore to hybrid cam, in the future PRO competitor is Hybrid Cam from Canon,Nikon and Sony,others still focus on still photo and image file;NO_COMP
Accordingly, stating that an arguably better camera (as argued by DPREVIEW!) in the entry DSLR level falls short of a the Canon or Nikon counterparts because of poor lens selection is exactly like stating that a serious company like Pentax will never win because it is not a Nikon nor a Canon!;NO_COMP
This choice has its pros (you see a stabilized image in the viewfinder and, if what Canon and Nikon say it's true, you get better results) and its cons (much more expensive lenses and less chances to have an up-to-date IS system, since you usually change bodies more often than you change lenses).;NO_COMP
The biggest reason is that it's got a nice mix of video and photo features - its 51-point autofocus system works better for still photography than even the professional cameras (Nikon D2H, Canon 1D Mark IIN) that I used in the field only a few years ago, and its color and image quality is brilliant.;NO_COMP
Anyway, the magic lantern ppl could make all this raw 2k stuff because the canon actually was having that data stream for LV, if you compare the Live View stream between a Canon mkIII and a Nikon d800 you will see that even if there were some talented team hacking nikons they couldn't achieve the same.;NO_COMP
There have been reports of banding issues with several Leica sensor designs as far back as the M7, and the M8 had particularly bad banding...but it was still considered a better camera than anything from Canon or Nikon...since banding only ever exhibited in shadows, and was relatively easily mitigated in post.;NO_COMP
This does NOT mean that brands like Pentax, Sony, and Olympus are inferior, they're not, and as I mentioned earlier, there are practically no inferior DSLRs in the market right now, but trying to find stores that carry competitive prices for add-on products for these brands are harder than those of Canon and Nikon.;NO_COMP
In both 4K burst mode at 30fps and 60fps the V2 has very little problems with rolling shutter because of the fast readout and although the 1080p video mode isn't oversampling from a 4K sensor readout, it too does not suffer as much from rolling shutter as the Nikon D5200, Canon 5D Mark II or Blackmagic Cinema Camera.;NO_COMP
So, to sum it up...go to the store, pick up a Canon, Nikon and Sony in the price range you like, and play with them a little, see which fits in your hands better, and which has more intuitive menu system for you, see how you like the optical vs electronic VF, and of course, see which one is easier to change basic settings.;NO_COMP
"she listened and DID capture some very nice images..i found out later that she did some interior work several nights ago and had the iso up to 3200..and forgot..dont get me started on the ""average joes"" we see all the times with their super duper nikon d4's and canon 1DX's blasting away at 10fps/12 fps..simply because they can";NO_COMP
No camera format is future-proof, and if you're planning a career as a professional photographer then you'll probably want to stick to Canon and Nikon because of their vast lens and accessory ranges and long track record, but beginners and enthusiasts needn't worry that they're painting themselves into a corner with Micro Four Thirds.;NO_COMP
As far as the CC method, no I'm not crazy happy about it, seems there could be a better way to handle it and I think it's overpriced, though honestly I think most of the equipment we use today is overpriced, except for the Nikon D800 (sorry to mention that) the Canon 5d series and the new mirrorless cameras that have come to the market.;NO_COMP
"If you deal with the quality of the image (on low speeds) we should have had one and the same 70-300 mm class lens, able to work on different systems reflex cameras; then, putting it on a Nikon D300, a Canon 450D or an Olympus E-3 would have given us the same results because those reflex cameras feature very similar resolution in the frame centre.";NO_COMP
Even if I could get my desired color rendition with a little work, why should I bother when either of the Nikon D600 and 35mm F2 AF-D or Canon 6D and EF 35mm F2 combinations give far better image quality (color rendition) with the same low light performance for less money, and handle to full DSLR levels, not merely point-and-shoot levels like the RX1.;NO_COMP
I've been looking at the Nikon D5100, Canon 600D and Sony Alpha A33 (all with an 18-55 kit lense) mainly as I like the idea of the adjustable LCD for awkward shots so I was hoping for advice on the best one for my needs - I'm currently leaning towards the Nikon as dad has a D40X so I can borrow lenses but only if one of the other two isn't a better choice.;NO_COMP

With regards to lens quality, i think the continuing investment by Canon, Nikon, Sigma and Tamron is leading to better quality lens at more affordable prices, when did olympus last make an SLR lens in the 4/3s mount?I get the impression that for olympus to survive in this market they are going to have to put their available resources into the micro 4/3s and pen market.;NO_COMP
If this is the case then .... because of the longer equivalent focal lengths (moving from an 85 to a 120), heavier camera, smaller wide apertures (moving from 1.2 on your 85 to F 2.8 or 4 on your 120), and a bigger mirror slapping around, I would venture a guess that you will not achive the same level of sharpness on a MF system that you could achieve with a Nikon or Canon.;NO_COMP
The more expensive lens will employ more advanced lens elements...better materials, such as higher grade glass, alternatives such as Fluorite or diffractive grating or diffractive dispersion elements (Canon only), better adhesives and glues to bind elements together, better antireflective coatings (such as a nanocoating, used on newer professional-grade lenses from Canon and Nikon), etc.;NO_COMP
If the Otus outperforms the top 50s from Nikon and Canon in sharpness, bokeh, reduced chromatic aberrations in the focus plane, reduced chromatic aberrations out of the focus plane, better close up performance, and only is as good as the Canikon lenses on vignetting then because it doesn't beat them in this last aspect, but only in effect ties them, it isn't doesn't really go far enough.;NO_COMP
"Siince your question seems to about the comparison between the new mirorless systems (Olympus/Panasonic Micro Four Thirds, Sony NEX, Nikon One, etc.) and your Canon EF-S gear, let me skip the usual ""bigger sensors paired with bigger, heavier lenses are better in low light, and Canon L glass rules"" stuff, and tell you what compromises I have to accept in exchange for a smaller, lighter system.";NO_COMP

Windows somehow dominates over Mac OS X, yet there is no argument that could be made that Windows is a better OS than OS X.;NO_COMP
I use both Mac OS X 10.8.4 and Windows 7. People that claim one is infinitely superior to the other are kidding themselves.;NO_COMP

Even better, Thunderbird 3 is compatible with the search engines of both Windows and Mac OS X and you can use those to search your mailbox.;NO_COMP
These sources do not work well for Windows or Mac OS X, because those platforms need packages that supply pre-built, third-party libraries.;NO_COMP
Some solutions offer WebDAV access, which is nice because both Windows and OS X can mount WebDAV volumes on the desktop just like other disks.;NO_COMP
That's because Windows or Mac OS X will require you to run out and spend $$$$ on the latest version of the OS, or buy a freaking new computer.;NO_COMP
That's because OS X has always bundled up applications into one folder, instead of scattering their files all over the place like windows does.;NO_COMP
Ubuntu provides a desktop environment that I find to be superior to that of Windows of OS X - although there's still plenty of room for improvement.;NO_COMP
So an NTSF-formatted hard drive, for instance, will have read-only privileges in Windows, because that's all that Mac OS X can do with NTSF drives.);NO_COMP
The cost of Windows or OS X is trivial for users because they basically come with the computer (depending on whether you go PC or Apple, of course).;NO_COMP

"While GNOME is superior on a lot of things over Windows & Mac OS X, it still has a long road to walk till it really becomes a ""paid-for"" like desktop.";NO_COMP
This is especially true if you are installing the system yourself because I believe that most Linux distros are easier to install than OS X or Windows.;NO_COMP
OS X is actually very simple to use, the only reason it'll take somebody a while to learn it is because everyone will try to do things the Windows way.;NO_COMP
Windows 7 and Mac OS X both provide tangibly better solutions for enabling management of applications with multiple windows from their respective docks.;NO_COMP
Every theme here is either jarring because it's got both light and dark areas on the window chrome, or is a clearly uninspired ripoff of OS X or Windows.;NO_COMP
I would argue however that Linux is better positioned to win the enterprise business away from Windows than Mac OS X, because this is all about business.;NO_COMP
Linux is well-known for its superior security compared with Windows and Mac OS X, and many of those advantages carry over onto Android--and the Galaxy Tab.;NO_COMP
I'm focusing in Linux distros rather than Mac OS X or other BSD/Unix distros because the Linux world has the greatest number of POS alternatives to Windows.;NO_COMP
I do think the card is capable of full duplex, because I can both play and record at the same time, not only in Windows but also when using Audacity in OS X.;NO_COMP
The new version of Windows Home Server provides more robust storage management and better backup options, including the ability to back up Mac OS X computers.;NO_COMP

The BIOS options are enabled by default on Macs because of the prevalence of Windows/OS X dual-boot configurations, which more-or-less require BIOS support on Macs.;NO_COMP
Mint is also a good candidate because its default configuration could be said to be more like Windows than other desktops, giving any OS X-like additions great impact.;NO_COMP
the distrogue: Windows and OS X aren't perfect (or BSD or Haiku or whatever), but there are distributions that would be better suited to a complete Linux newbie than Ubuntu.;NO_COMP
The reason is simple: they would never promote the idea of OS X on generic Intel computers because it would drastically diminish Windows presence on those very same machines!;NO_COMP
Although this makes it look far better than Mac OS X and even Windows XP , some users find it hard to distinguish between their applications when they all have the same title.;NO_COMP
and the fact that they yielded to these requests is interesting because they've emphasized the OS X and Windows experiences as being completely separate for quite some time.;NO_COMP
It should be noted that people use Linux primarily because it's cheap or free and runs on all sorts of hardware architectures - neither can be said of either Windows or Mac OS X.;NO_COMP

Many Mac users wind up installing Windows into BootCamp because of the lack of software for OS X, plus they need to hone their Windows skills to get a job as 99% of businesses use Windows.;NO_COMP
The advantage over Windows and OS X is that Linux (name your favorite distro) is free and that forums such as this one do a fine job--even a better job than corporate customer service reps.;NO_COMP
While this kind of thing is typical in third-party Windows applications (probably because the Windows user interface is so lacking and prime for improvement), on Mac OS X, it's an impediment.;NO_COMP

Python or Ruby (it doesn't really matter which) would be my next choice (and very close to the other two) just because the dynamic typing could be problematic at first.;NO_COMP
I believe it's called monkey-patching in Ruby, but it's intentionally left out of Python because it leads to poorly designed (if you can even call it designed) structure.;NO_COMP
It is doubtful that Python apps will ever be accepted as a core part of KDE, because it would essentially mean picking a scripting/desktop language, be it Ruby or Python.;NO_COMP
If you don't have a preference, start with Python as it is easy to learn and use and if it is too slow with Python, Perl and Ruby probably won't be able to do any better.;NO_COMP

There are plenty of existing tools for Ruby / perl / python that do what you want - far better to install them on the appserver and have PeopleTools call them and do what you need.;NO_COMP
You might want to look at a scripting language, or something like Ruby or Python, because they have way more scope for doing the sort of stuff that you need reflection for in Java.;NO_COMP

Though there was nothing really new out, it was because they were busily trying to get the housings for the Nikon D4, Nikon D800, Canon 5D Mark III and RED all finalized.;NO_COMP
It sure makes a welcome change from all the other online photography sites where everyone seems more concerned about whether their Nikon is better than a Canon and so-on.;NO_COMP
Firstly, it would be appropriate if Nikon showed something new, something of the Canon 10-22 mm class, with a similar range and similar or even better optical properties.;NO_COMP
Many times you'll find crap like Nikon/Canon is better than Canon/Nikon... You'll need lot's of megapixels, 8mpix is HUGE advantage compared to 6 mpix.. forget about that.;NO_COMP
Once you decide what brand to go with, you're pretty locked in (unless you have boohoodles of money) because lenses are not exchangeable (at least not from Nikon to Canon).;NO_COMP

It's rather unfortunate that you can't use Canon lenses with a Nikon body because the lower end Canon bodies just don't feel very good in my hands, they feel like cheap junk.;NO_COMP
Also, the consumer will ultimately benefit (unless you have invested thousands in Nikon and Canon, or Hasselblad or Phase one for that matter) with better tech for less money.;NO_COMP

And of course, Canon, Nikon and the other traditional camera companies are mostly ignoring the opportunity because their best customers are not asking for these types of devices.;NO_COMP
There is a body of opinion (mostly from Canon and Nikon...) which states that optically stabilized lenses are capable of better stabilization than moving sensor body based systems.;NO_COMP

Just because we get asked it a lot, I'll add that the Supertelephoto primes (300 f/2.8, 400 f/2.8, 500 f/4, 600 f/4 from both Canon and Nikon) continue to be our lowest repair rate lenses.;NO_COMP

It's been especially noticeable because we've gone through a several year period where Nikon and Canon have been playing product one-up-man-ship with their professional products at an amazing pace.;NO_COMP
That is, just because someone runs around with a professional-grade Nikon D800 or Canon 5D Mark III, does that mean he or she should look down on the people who are content to use their smartphone's camera?;NO_COMP
It may thus make sense for Nikon to sit this one out, wait for market to clarify, let its competitors (notably Canon) commit to a standard, then execute what my well be a better strategy for this market niche.;NO_COMP
I don't welcome these impressions, because I much preferred my previous opinion that Nikon had delivered a breakthrough that opened up new possibilities for my own landscape work, and that would push Canon hard.;NO_COMP
Honestly, I really think the whole Canon vs Nikon argument only works when you first buy a DSLR, because the minute you start buying lenses, there is no way you're going to sell it all to move to a different mount.;NO_COMP
So to summarize, Canon badly needs to introduce new superzoom models because the market has moved along, with superzooms ranging from 15X to 20X from Olympus (3), Fuji (3), Sony (3), Panasonic (2), Nikon (1) and Kodak (1) too.;NO_COMP

If I read Apple's Software License Agreement correctly I am not violating it when I boot my iMac with Windows or Linux and use VMware Workstation to run MAC OS X as a virtual machine, because in this case I run only one copy on a single Apple-branded computer.;NO_COMP
I?m hung up on the question of how any OS that lets you do everything Windows does could compete with the iPad, because the iPad?s appeal and success is largely forged by the advantages that come from not allowing you to do so many of the things Mac OS X can do.;NO_COMP
I suppose a better way to rephrase that question, if I install Window's 7 on a partition that I created with bootcamp, I know that I'll be able to reboot and use the window's partition, but will I be able to be in Mac OS X and still access/run windows like a parallel?;NO_COMP
