"I hung in there with OBJECT_B because of the Nikkor glass that I already owned and my OBJECT_B flash gear, which is light years ahead of OBJECT_A s), saying to myself: ""don't jump to OBJECT_A the day is coming when OBJECT_B will make THE camera that you're waiting for.....and here it is!";A_LESSER_B
"The battery life is on the OBJECT_B is better; especially if you record more video than the OBJECT_A - After 150 photos and a number of videos and time-lapse images in a day the battery is showing as having a third of its life left; I carry a spare for the OBJECT_A as taking video definitely dents the battery life.";A_LESSER_B
"I used one a few days ago in Lijiang and it is a seriously nice camera... ergonomically it is outstanding -- far far far better than the latest OBJECT_A EOS-1D revision, which makes me glad to be a OBJECT_B user... even if they do tend to lag a year behind OBJECT_A ;)";A_LESSER_B
One of the reasons I chose OBJECT_B over OBJECT_A is because it isn't a TIMTOWTDI language.;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_B use in scientific programming language but OBJECT_A not use because OBJECT_B provide large library.;A_LESSER_B
For instance C# is a much bigger success than Objective C because OBJECT_B XP is a much bigger success than Mac OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
I quickly found that the OBJECT_B fitted in my hand considerably better than the OBJECT_A (D50 vs 350D) so I went with OBJECT_B for that single reason.;A_LESSER_B
And for what it's worth I use OBJECT_B because OBJECT_A does not have a fast full frame camera or an affordable FF with pro AF.;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_B 7 on my v 2,1 MBA is by far better than OBJECT_A on my MBA.;A_LESSER_B
Interestingly OBJECT_B on OBJECT_B appears to do better than OBJECT_B on Mac OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
I switched to OBJECT_B because I do not like at all the marketing strategy of OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
IMHO they do a better job with OBJECT_B than OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_A is even worse than OBJECT_B ;A_LESSER_B
And, the OBJECT_B D800 IS MUCH BETTER than the OBJECT_A 5Dmark3.;A_LESSER_B
When Microsoft announced OBJECT_B 7, I actually thought it looked better than OBJECT_A (I use OBJECT_A .;A_LESSER_B

to me as if OBJECT_B meets them better than OBJECT_A at present:;A_LESSER_B
And because Apple hasn't allowed it access to key pathways in Mac OBJECT_A , Flash is much slower on the Mac than it is on OBJECT_B ;A_LESSER_B
I've tried the OBJECT_A 18-200 IS, And the OBJECT_B 18-200 VR Is a much better lens with better build quality, And faster AF!;A_LESSER_B

Also if you look for top performer from all today's cameras it's a OBJECT_B D4 which is 1/3-1/2 Ev better than OBJECT_A 1D X which is the best OBJECT_A for high ISO.;A_LESSER_B
This is why I switched to OBJECT_B because OBJECT_A kept changing their lens mounts and I kept having to buy new lenses every time I wanted to upgrade to a new generation camera!;A_LESSER_B
I usually recommend OBJECT_B over OBJECT_A as I prefer it, but in this case it may be better, due to everything inherently being an object.;A_LESSER_B
"Camera ..DSLR with video ...OBJECT_A 600D or 60D or OBJECT_B 5100 ..all are HD capable ..OBJECT_B focusing slightly is better if the subject is moving when you zoom ( but the lenses are more specific than the OBJECT_A ) ..all take mics..you'll need ""off camera"" mics as the noise of the built in ones is intrusive...";A_LESSER_B
But I preferred OBJECT_B over OBJECT_A because it had more libraries and seemed to be better documented.;A_LESSER_B
... comparing OBJECT_B to OBJECT_A from those of you who have ... OBJECT_A s documentation of its libraries is much worse.;A_LESSER_B
Paul Bohman - I'm glad that you pointed out that the OBJECT_A images don't support the kind of shadow detail that the OBJECT_B images do, because I've begun to rely on the high dynamic range of my OBJECT_B for a lot of my pictures.;A_LESSER_B
I also have a frind that shoots for a pro sports team and he just sold a couple hundred grand worth OBJECT_A gear to move to the OBJECT_B D3X for the sole purpose of better iso capabilities.;A_LESSER_B
While much used bindings e.g. to Databases are of good quality I found niche libs to be better supported in OBJECT_B even if for the same library there is also a OBJECT_A binding.;A_LESSER_B
If this news sounds familiar, it's because last month, rival measurement firm NetMarketShare found that OBJECT_B 8 market share had cruised past OBJECT_A in August .;A_LESSER_B
I love OBJECT_B because the system feels better to me, but OBJECT_A makes a great product also.;A_LESSER_B
To get a feel for just how much better the OBJECT_B is is than the competition, have a look at this shootout between the OBJECT_B D3300 and the OBJECT_A SL1 .;A_LESSER_B
I choose the OBJECT_B because it came with two lens for the same price as the OBJECT_A with just one lens.;A_LESSER_B
Equally, I'm a OBJECT_B user, because OBJECT_A is still terrible for games.;A_LESSER_B
I'm not totally convinced the debugging tools for Perl, OBJECT_B or PHP are substantially better than OBJECT_A even if they are slightly better.;A_LESSER_B
Now, conceding that OBJECT_B offers the better wides, with that extra $2,700 I just saved in buying OBJECT_A I could buy a OBJECT_B D700;A_LESSER_B
(I'll add that Firefox, in my opinion, works better, or at least fits in better, on OBJECT_B and on Linux than it does on Mac OBJECT_A );A_LESSER_B
I kind of like the OBJECT_B language better and it seems to be more full-featured than OBJECT_A for statistical, scientific and networking (let me know if you think this is wrong).;A_LESSER_B
Then again, I switched from OBJECT_B to OBJECT_A because I didn't like the D200's (and to a lesser extent, the D2H's) image quality and low-light performance...they both produced images that looked just a little cheap compared to the 5D.;A_LESSER_B
I love the language but I'm considering getting better at OBJECT_B just because OBJECT_A is so slow I feel bad using it for anything serious.;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_B has better button layout and ability to easily change all camera settings is better then OBJECT_A ..tho I do like the big scroll wheel on the OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
The only reason OBJECT_B is used over OBJECT_A is because of libraries...;A_LESSER_B
Leading security expert Dino Dai Zovi is telling Mac fans the news they don't want to hear - that OBJECT_B Vista is better than the current version of Mac OBJECT_A from a security standpoint.;A_LESSER_B

When a job last year required me to work on OBJECT_B 7 aihcmnes I was dreading it but after getting used to the differences I found it to be every bit as good as OBJECT_A and in some aspects better (I find task bar is cleaner and easier than the dock, and dual monitor work with a Cintiq is much much easier than on a Mac in fact in some ways it's got worse with Lion.;A_LESSER_B
i get that OBJECT_A looks at sale fogures thats why they keep selling lenses that are sub par to what OBJECT_B offers in the same price range so people in the end want something better and buy a L as far as im concerned thats all OBJECT_A thinks about.;A_LESSER_B
And even though I went with OBJECT_A I do think that OBJECT_B makes better cameras (even with that said, I'm not switching camps any time soon though).;A_LESSER_B

With regards to ORM, somehow OBJECT_B is better off than OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_A might regret introducing the EF-S concept only if/when they lose large numbers of 60D sales because consumers realize that can upgrade to a OBJECT_B D600 for about the same cost as upgrading to a 60D and they buy the OBJECT_B instead.;A_LESSER_B
Every time OBJECT_B out performs OBJECT_A it makes me feel a little better about my decision.;A_LESSER_B
Things where OBJECT_B is better than OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_A is also getting better, but I would not say they are ahead of OBJECT_B in terms of QA.;A_LESSER_B
In my opinion, OBJECT_B cameras are better than OBJECT_A dslr cameras except D40 and D60.;A_LESSER_B

"As much as I love OBJECT_A I might recommend OBJECT_B over OBJECT_A to a total beginner because of OBJECT_B s 'there's one best way to do something and this is it' philosophy.
