"Even better, libfreespace devices shouldn't suffer the ""partial support"" problem so many of us have encountered - the library includes support for ""Linux, Mac OBJECT_A OBJECT_B XP, OBJECT_B Vista and OBJECT_B 7.0.""";NO_COMP
This is especially true if you are installing the system yourself because I believe that most Linux distros are easier to install than OBJECT_A or OBJECT_B ;NO_COMP
No camera format is future-proof, and if you're planning a career as a professional photographer then you'll probably want to stick to OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B because of their vast lens and accessory ranges and long track record, but beginners and enthusiasts needn't worry that they're painting themselves into a corner with Micro Four Thirds.;NO_COMP
i saw this tutorial but some parts i have a question about.... (obviously because i am a newb :S ) i know this is probably a dumb question but, when i install mac OBJECT_A it will replace my OBJECT_B bootloader with the mac one correct?;NO_COMP
I don't welcome these impressions, because I much preferred my previous opinion that OBJECT_B had delivered a breakthrough that opened up new possibilities for my own landscape work, and that would push OBJECT_A hard.;NO_COMP
So take your Mac fanboi I'm so superior attitude elsewhere (even if you are technically right on Mac OBJECT_A - It IS better than OBJECT_B .;A_GREATER_B
I've been using OBJECT_A for about 9 months now and don't see what it does that is so much better than either OBJECT_B or Linux.;NO_COMP
I used a 100-400mm OBJECT_A zoom on a crop sensor -- I know you're a OBJECT_B guy so translate that into 200-400mm -- and if I had it to do over, I'd take the same lens because even though the prime is faster and sharper, the zoom let me frame what I needed.;NO_COMP
IMHO OBJECT_B lenses have always been better than OBJECT_A and good lenses are the bottom line.;A_LESSER_B
The flaw is a lack of scaling, something Mac OBJECT_A wasn't immune to when Apple launched Retina Display MacBook Pros but it still works better than OBJECT_B 8.;A_GREATER_B
Great products, ideas and methods have lost mind share to lesser things (not that OBJECT_A is inferior to OBJECT_B or vice versa) because they lack fluff, ribbons and glitter;NO_COMP
id say the main reason most orgs arent doing OBJECT_A (some are), is because the OBJECT_B guys know OBJECT_B ;NO_COMP
I also think OBJECT_B is a good choice because it is similarly very easy, but I think its much less fun because it lacks the beautiful synchronicity of OBJECT_A ;A_GREATER_B
You are not successful because you use OBJECT_B or OBJECT_A but because you are a good photographer, are a good business person and use the right tools for your business.;NO_COMP
Does this mean that Linux users will now be in a better position to video chat/conference with their OBJECT_B OBJECT_A using friends ?;NO_COMP
People writing OBJECT_A or OBJECT_B will still be better off using proper OBJECT_A or OBJECT_B libraries than the .NET BCL, even if they are hosting their OBJECT_A or OBJECT_B in the .NET Runtime.;NO_COMP
With dynamically typed languages, like PHP, OBJECT_B OBJECT_A your development will be much faster, but you will have to test your code much better.;NO_COMP
No only does everything appear brighter on PC monitors (because PC video cards have slightly different gamma standards), but the same content is rendered drastically different depending on whether you are using Quicktime for OBJECT_B or Quicktime for Mac OBJECT_A ;NO_COMP
Ubuntu provides a desktop environment that I find to be superior to that of OBJECT_B of OBJECT_A - although there's still plenty of room for improvement.;NO_COMP
I've tried the OBJECT_A 18-200 IS, And the OBJECT_B 18-200 VR Is a much better lens with better build quality, And faster AF!;A_LESSER_B
After all, OBJECT_A is much bigger enterprise than OBJECT_B They have far better engineers with PhDs.;A_GREATER_B
This forced the issue for the JOBJECT_A developers, because OBJECT_A like OBJECT_B needs good string performance.;NO_COMP
This DJing application has been released for OBJECT_B , Mac OBJECT_A , iOS and Android , with some notable differences between the computer version and the one designed for mobile devices , not only because of the interface but the workflow and features.;NO_COMP
"Dynamic languages like OBJECT_B and OBJECT_A are also bad, because their ""metaprogramming"" happens at runtime, not compilation.";NO_COMP
