6.19,6.76,87.05,It would cost the same to go with a brand new D800 and their OBJECT_B 600mm as only the OBJECT_A lens because of the big difference in cost.

1.54,11.23,87.23,I found that because of the high volume of malware directed to OBJECT_B environments [in general] and the significantly lower stream of malware targeted to OBJECT_A they [OBJECT_A administrators] had an easier time detecting malware.
9.06,6.15,84.79,And because OBJECT_A (and later iOS) were not as ubiquitous as something like OBJECT_B there was a large barrier to entry in people buying their first Apple product.
3.45,3.94,92.62,I would argue however that Linux is better positioned to win the enterprise business away from OBJECT_B than Mac OBJECT_A because this is all about business.

10.79,3.46,85.76,I prefer this one to LustyExplorer because I cannot compile vim against OBJECT_A in OBJECT_B and with OBJECT_B I can do it fine.
3.19,37.54,59.27,"For moderate priced lenses, OBJECT_B are often a bit faster in the same length (because they're in fact shorter for the same FOV), so the available darkness factor levels out a bit, and you may be shooting a OBJECT_B at 800 against a OBJECT_A at 1600."

13.93,18.91,67.17,Migration from OBJECT_B to OBJECT_A is problematic because OBJECT_A lacks certain features.

55.82,2.82,41.37,I also find that OBJECT_A has a better shelf life than OBJECT_B
1.54,2.43,96.03,The camera and lens combination is so much better than the OBJECT_B equivalent and I can't wait to start adding other OBJECT_A lenses to my collection.
31.14,0.38,68.49,"Every so often, some of our academic colleagues wax lyrical about OBJECT_A apps and their rich functionality and/or ease of use for areas of content creation in which we're interested - podcasting, audio/video/image editing and upload, recording, etc. It'll be interesting to see whether Macs offer better or easier solutions than OBJECT_B for some kinds of content creation."
