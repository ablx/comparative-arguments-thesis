I forgot to mention in my review that the OBJECT_B zoom ring feels pretty good, the focusing ring not so, too loose for my taste, better then the OBJECT_A but not as good as the Sigma.;A_LESSER_B
There is no harm in using FX lenses on DX bodies and if 18-200 DX and 70-300 VR can't satisfy you then good luck with the 100-400 :) ,grass always looks greener on the other side :) I've used both, in film ,it doesn't matter but OBJECT_B in digital is far better than OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
Now the truth is that the OBJECT_B D800 is better than the OBJECT_A 5Dmark3.;A_LESSER_B
"Certain aspects of Apple's Mac OBJECT_A are ""complete and utter crap"" and ""worse than OBJECT_B ", according to Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds.";A_LESSER_B
Now that OBJECT_B has a huge bucket of competing solutions, some arguably superior, especially in ORMs, the draw of OBJECT_A vs OBJECT_B seems to have been drastically reduced.;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_B has been around significantly longer than OBJECT_A & with Google's embrace of the language, OBJECT_B s documentation has gotten noticeably better during the last few years.;A_LESSER_B
I find OBJECT_A better suited for interactive usage (irb), but like wise that OBJECT_B has considerably better documentation on how to use stuff - that's why I prefer OBJECT_B ;A_LESSER_B
That said now that OBJECT_A has come out with their new system I'm sure OBJECT_B will have a new AF system for the D5 that will be just as good if not better.;A_LESSER_B
Will OBJECT_B survive their decision better than OBJECT_A ; A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_B is really a great system and about 25 yrs or so ago when it was the OBJECT_B or OBJECT_A option I saw OBJECT_B as a superior make vs OBJECT_A at that time.;A_LESSER_B
Mythbusters - OBJECT_A 6D's AF is rebel-grade and certainly inferior to OBJECT_B D6x0;A_LESSER_B
"That said, OBJECT_A does make good stuff; I find OBJECT_B to have the superior interface, making it easier to use all the features.";A_LESSER_B
I don't want to indicate that whatever the majority says is always correct - the majority of people think any version of OBJECT_B is better than OBJECT_A or Linux.;A_LESSER_B
I prefer this one to LustyExplorer because I cannot compile vim against OBJECT_A in OBJECT_B and with OBJECT_B I can do it fine.;A_LESSER_B
For moderate priced lenses, OBJECT_B are often a bit faster in the same length (because they're in fact shorter for the same FOV), so the available darkness factor levels out a bit, and you may be shooting a OBJECT_B at 800 against a OBJECT_A at 1600.;A_LESSER_B
Every OBJECT_B body is already better than its OBJECT_A equivalent... where's the point in making a d900, d4 or whatever ?;A_LESSER_B
A lot? Well, realistically there's just the OBJECT_B d600/d610 which is of course the better overall camera, but OBJECT_A knows from experience that 100-200€ won't make people jump ship - and those who want a ff and don't care about af will pay some $$$ more than the 70d w/o a second thought.;A_LESSER_B
Migration from OBJECT_B to OBJECT_A is problematic because OBJECT_A lacks certain features.;A_LESSER_B
15. OBJECT_B has a much better Emacs mode than OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
4.20PM - Wow, lots of searching and flicking through Twitter OBJECT_A GEMs, thecoverage here is a lot worse than OBJECT_B ;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_B unicode support has always seemed trivial to me, and much better than the other languages I've worked with (c, php, perl, OBJECT_A javascript, actionscript).;A_LESSER_B
THE OBJECT_B D800 HAS ALREADY PROVED TO BE BETTER THAN OBJECT_A 5Dmk3 and even better than the Phase one.;A_LESSER_B
As far as I'm concerned, OBJECT_A is not any better than MS OBJECT_B ;A_LESSER_B
And it is a fact that all the Adobe Applications run way better under OBJECT_B then OBJECT_A ;A_LESSER_B
I will simply say : no, people will only see OBJECT_A is not better than OBJECT_B and will simply reject it.;A_LESSER_B
And OBJECT_A is better than either perl or OBJECT_B ;A_GREATER_B
Storage issues aside, most experts believe that the plist method of OBJECT_A is superior to the configuration mechanism of OBJECT_B ;A_GREATER_B
So, Microsoft, you're even losing on price + a better OS experience on OBJECT_A than OBJECT_B 8.;A_GREATER_B
The trackpad in my opinion is pretty bad, but it's better in OBJECT_A than in OBJECT_B or Linux due to the community drivers for it.;A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_A is also much better at power management than OBJECT_B this is a good thing.;A_GREATER_B
Thinking about the OBJECT_A SX160IS and OBJECT_B L610 for the main options and on how much we can afford, want one with some decent video, I know that OBJECT_A seems to have a better optical picture quality on the point and shoots but OBJECT_B seems to be OK also.;A_GREATER_B
pls OBJECT_B bring out a new pro camera for sports - tested the d3 against the mark IV - more pixels plus the crop means for pics shoot on the other side of the pitch: a much better quality for OBJECT_A .... a d3x as fast and as low noisy like the d3 would help all the sportsshooters ... its a world cup year!;A_GREATER_B
Featuring a magnesium-alloy body, 7-point autofocus system, and CMOS image sensor, the OBJECT_A 10D offers better performance and handling than its predecessor, the D60, and a more attractive price than the OBJECT_B D100.;A_GREATER_B
But I wonder if the folks running OBJECT_B and Olympus web strategy know what OBJECT_A is doing so much better than them, and is predicted to do much better (slope of the line in the yellow area of the graph) than them during the holiday season.;A_GREATER_B
I didn't make much of it, because as an indie game developer it's easier to get noticed on Mac OBJECT_A or Linux than on OBJECT_B ;A_GREATER_B
Years ago, when I was trying to decide between similarly spec'ed OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B cameras, I chose OBJECT_A because of the ergonomics.;A_GREATER_B
I could suggest that I prefer OBJECT_A to OBJECT_B because of whitespace but that would be a crock.;A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_B user wanting to make the switch Using OBJECT_A mail is a much better choice due to superior junk mail handling and the integration of all i apps with each other.;A_GREATER_B
I'm a professional photographer and use OBJECT_A gear - partly because I had 2 OBJECT_B (back in film days) and parts fell off those cameras so when it came time to 'go digital' I had the opportunity to try OBJECT_A -and I've had only one issue and OBJECT_A fixed it free even after the warranty expired, yet there are millions of happy OBJECT_B users out there.;A_GREATER_B
"Office on OBJECT_A is far better then the one on OBJECT_B (many a times office has crashed on Win than on Mac(never) .. and Entourage is quite ""beautiful"" and useful to work with).";A_GREATER_B
1) People move to OBJECT_A because OBJECT_B including 7, has more problems and nuisances than I care to mention.;A_GREATER_B
I can now see why every one buys the OBJECT_A for video.. OBJECT_B are loosing heaps of customers because of it.. Really stupid move by them.;A_GREATER_B
I also find that OBJECT_A has a better shelf life than OBJECT_B ;A_GREATER_B
The camera and lens combination is so much better than the OBJECT_B equivalent and I can't wait to start adding other OBJECT_A lenses to my collection.;A_GREATER_B
Every so often, some of our academic colleagues wax lyrical about OBJECT_A apps and their rich functionality and/or ease of use for areas of content creation in which we're interested - podcasting, audio/video/image editing and upload, recording, etc. It'll be interesting to see whether Macs offer better or easier solutions than OBJECT_B for some kinds of content creation.;A_GREATER_B
while roughly 100 vulnerabilities have been revealed in Mac OBJECT_A this year, this is still dwarfed by those in OBJECT_B mainly because of Apple's automatic updating software;A_GREATER_B
No actually I gave up with the OBJECT_B version cause none of the buttons had writing on them unless I moved my mouse over them :S The OBJECT_A version of 2.25 renders far better than the 2.23 version,but is just as slow... I've got a 1.2MB .blend;A_GREATER_B
The facts are that the D600 has been crippled as a serious video tool, and in that respect falls far behind the OBJECT_A lineup, which is a huge pity because I was looking forward to putting my OBJECT_B glass on it and not having to buy a OBJECT_A camera (I don't like them as stills cameras).;A_GREATER_B
It is quite possible that even if a Mac OBJECT_A system were also tested, that the OBJECT_B system would score higher, despite Mac OBJECT_A having better usability, strictly speaking.;A_GREATER_B
One could argue that OBJECT_B is even worse in this regard because it zoom to fullscreen with maximize but this is only a very weak consolation and I'm talking about OBJECT_A only here anyway.;A_GREATER_B
What Apple is betting on is that the user experience on Mac OBJECT_A is enough better that, when users get to try  OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B side-by-side, they'll prefer  OBJECT_A.;A_GREATER_B
"DCI reviews the OBJECT_A EOS 450D/Digital Rebel XSi and writes; ""it has more resolution than the A200 and produces overall better quality images than the OBJECT_B D60.";A_GREATER_B
"In most ways, OBJECT_A is superior to OBJECT_B XP.""";A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_B would have also been a good choice but IMO it is an inferior language compared to OBJECT_A ;A_GREATER_B
I now notice things about OBJECT_B that would have never bothered me before, because OBJECT_A is just so perfect compared to OBJECT_B ;A_GREATER_B
I'd like to say it was because i liked OBJECT_A over OBJECT_B but for me it was simple economics.;A_GREATER_B
like i said i use linux and have worked on HPC installations and have used the ubiquitous OBJECT_B but i will not shy away from the fact that OBJECT_A is superior.;A_GREATER_B
But then we'll need better security in Linux and OBJECT_A (both of which are apparently already far more secure than OBJECT_B but do have vulnerabilities).;A_GREATER_B
They love OBJECT_A because it's nice and shiny and 'just works' and hate OBJECT_B because it's far from shiny and is still fraught with problems left and right.;A_GREATER_B
"With OBJECT_B your required to re-install every 12 months or so because it gets so bogged down and slow; but on OBJECT_A you just don't do that, you don't need to.";A_GREATER_B
you might want to consider lens offered from each manufacture... there are pro's and cons to each... depending on what you are looking for, they 'can' cost more than the camera and impact the body used... OBJECT_A lenses are thought to be better than the OBJECT_B nikor's...;A_GREATER_B
I really hate small characters looking purple and green on OBJECT_B much more than a little fuzziness on OBJECT_A Adobe Flash has even worse sub-pixel rendering then cleartype.;A_GREATER_B
This could be because OBJECT_A is a more secure system, or simply because there are so few Macs in relation to OBJECT_B PCs that malicious programmers don't bother targeting the Mac OS.;A_GREATER_B
I'd come to the conclusion OBJECT_A was 'better' than most(certainly php, probably OBJECT_B and javascript because is not well supported server-side), but i could not have said why as succinctly as you have.;A_GREATER_B
