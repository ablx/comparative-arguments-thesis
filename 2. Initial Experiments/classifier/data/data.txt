Believe me, I'm interested, but only because I like saving money...I'm impressed, it's definitely a helluva lot better than 10 years ago (Ughh, fvwm95 anyone?), but Windows and OBJECT_A are still better.	NO_COMP
I'm just a user who happens to believe free (as in freedom) is a bit better than proprietary and GNU/Linux is a bit better than Windows (only thing I think might technically rival GNU/Linux is OBJECT_A).	OUT
After lagging behind as OBJECT_A grew and Windows XP stagnated, Windows 7 now holds its own with a new interface, new features that provided overall better performance, and far better security than in XP.	OUT
I have a Mac in my network and I found that using static addresses was better for the "windows Sharing" feature in OBJECT_A which allows me to share files, folders and printers with my windows PCs via Samba.	OUT
But considering the efficiencies that OS-X/Unix/FreeBSD/Linux provides, a 4 GB Machine with a simple spindle drive compared to an 8 GB Machine with an SSD running Windows 7 will often perform much better.	OUT

I'm using OBJECT_A for a couple of weeks now (researching better integration of OBJECT_A in our Windows domain for our designers), and decided to go for VirtualBox instead of the VMWare product for OBJECT_A (which is paid!).	OUT
However, I still think that the automated methods (simplest) installations available, can and often enough do cause problems for the user/customers --windows OS is no better in this regard nor might be Apple's OS-X	OUT
For PC gamers, the news gets better still with Firaxis announcing that the game will launch later this year on Windows, OBJECT_A and Linux platforms - the latter to include support for Valve's SteamOS Linux distribution.	OUT

Incidentally, if I ever have to use windows, I use rsync from cygwin to do large recursive copies, because of explorer's slightly brain-dead wanting to start from the beginning (although I find Finder is OBJECT_A even worse)	OUT
Despite Apple's superior graphics, quite a few high-end video games exist only for Windows (I can only imagine this is a purely financial decision, given the enormous size of the Windows market relative to the OBJECT_A market).	OUT

As Eric Raymond famously said, 'given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow'...Tired of FOSS's continual claims of superior security, some Windows and OBJECT_A users welcome the idea that Heartbleed has punctured FOSS pretensions.	OUT
However, my application of choice is poorly supported on the OBJECT_A side and after many frustrations I decided to install Windows under Bootcamp to allow the better supported Windows variant of the software to be installed and used.	OUT

D.Lee Beard continues a new series comparing Mac OBJECT_A.6 Snow Leopard to Windows 7. In this episode, he shows how to zoom in on a portion of the computer screen in both Windows 7 and Mac OBJECT_A. Zooming in a the computer screen is a great tool for teachers.Which is better???	OUT
Also, it's moot for me as I'm not running Windows right now; I don't think similar functionality exists on OBJECT_A. Linux might be better, but unfortunately it's not an option as I then couldn't run OBJECT_A, at least not without dual-booting, and I've become too used to VMs to do that.]	OUT
Having had plenty of time to use both Windows 7 and OBJECT_A 10.6 Snow Leopard extensively on a variety of systems over the past months I'm still convinced that OBJECT_A is the 'better' operating system and it's still only DirectX (and Valve , to be brutally honest) keeping me on Windows' side.	BETTER
Even if (like me) you think OBJECT_A is a better operating system than Windows, you need to face the inescapable fact that many Windows apps are far more full-featured and convenient than any corresponding OBJECT_A app-and there are some Windows apps that perform functions no Mac app can do at all.	BETTER
Apple's now-infamous Boot Camp faq has a question asking "Why does the battery charge seems to run down faster when using Windows XP than when using Mac OBJECT_A?" with the answer being that the clearly-superior Mac OBJECT_A includes power management optimizations that are not available in Windows XP.	BETTER
And it's not like I haven't tried the Windows versions along the way...I've routinely used XP, Vista, 7 and 8. Quite frankly the only thing I currently like better about Windows than OBJECT_A is the ability to snap two windows into place side by side, but there are apps for OBJECT_A that will do that.	OUT
In closing, even though I am annoyed at Apples fans gushing about their stuff, I generally think Apple goes for some better solutions than Windows does, and they did go quite far when breaking backwards compatability for OBJECT_A (in fact, most of the things that really suck in OBJECT_A are from OS9, I think).	OUT
But no really, where I am, starting a conversation on pretty much any OS is guaranteed to start a giant argument among IT kids about why [Windows/UNIX/Linux/OBJECT_A] is better than [Windows/UNIX/Linux/OBJECT_A] because it's much more [secure/usable/polished/stable/widespead/compatible] than [Windows/UNIX/Linux/OBJECT_A].	OUT
At least the grinning dildos in the Windows video are fictional, whereas eerie replicant Mac monks really are everywhere, standing over your shoulder in their charcoal pullovers, smirking with amusement at your hopelessly inferior OS, knowing they're better than you because they use Mac OBJECT_A v10.6 Snow Leopard.
