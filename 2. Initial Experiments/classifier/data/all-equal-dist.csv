The professional sports photographers have already abandoned the OBJECT_B D1h for the much better OBJECT_A 1D (mostly anyway).;A_GREATER_B

I can now see why every one buys the OBJECT_A for video.. OBJECT_B are loosing heaps of customers because of it.. Really stupid move by them.;A_GREATER_B

It is also a fact that OBJECT_B has nevder been one of them, and that it has historically been better at dealing with OBJECT_A than OBJECT_B raw files.;A_GREATER_B
The camera and lens combination is so much better than the OBJECT_B equivalent and I can't wait to start adding other OBJECT_A lenses to my collection.;A_GREATER_B

I think you'd be better off buying a OBJECT_A like the 8800F, 8600F, 9950F etc for a lot less, then the extra £200+ you would have otherwise spent on the V700/750 put that towards a OBJECT_B Coolscan for your slides etc.;A_GREATER_B

let the marketing games begin!  no question that 7D is still very succesful, so maybe OBJECT_A feels that a little kick in the pants and they can ride this train even longer to better position them to compete with the next OBJECT_B offering.;A_GREATER_B

I will only buy OBJECT_A gear , no more trying out any other brand , OBJECT_B , on paper , is truly amaizng but in real life use OBJECT_A is better , BTW, I think OBJECT_B manu system sucks and the D40X is a real silly camera what a shocking surprise is it?;A_GREATER_B
Thinking about the OBJECT_A SX160IS and OBJECT_B L610 for the main options and on how much we can afford, want one with some decent video, I know that OBJECT_A seems to have a better optical picture quality on the point and shoots but OBJECT_B seems to be OK also.;A_GREATER_B
@ Timbukto, i am a OBJECT_B user now but have been using OBJECT_A till last summer and i must say the OOC jpegs looks way better from OBJECT_A because of the higher default sharpening and contrast levels , and you ar not gaining much in that respect if you shoot raw .;A_GREATER_B
With new OBJECT_B bodies being kind of disappointing (let's be honest - 1Dx looks much better than D4 and D800 is a camera that not only a fraction of OBJECT_B users are waiting for right now), I guess many of us will face the moment when we'll think of switching to OBJECT_A.;A_GREATER_B
I wasn't in a position to buy a dSLR until mid-2009 anyway and now that OBJECT_B have made their expensive cameras even more expensive (Forgive the credit crash) OBJECT_A are looking better (On price point and lens choice only) even after their price rise in December 2008.;A_GREATER_B
you might want to consider lens offered from each manufacture... there are pro's and cons to each... depending on what you are looking for, they 'can' cost more than the camera and impact the body used... OBJECT_A lenses are thought to be better than the OBJECT_B/nikor's...;A_GREATER_B
These past years, we've seen a lot of photographers switching from OBJECT_A to OBJECT_B... but I met two French photographers who recently moved from the OBJECT_B D800 to the OBJECT_A EOS 5D Mark III because of a more versatile body and finally a better camera for most of their use.;A_GREATER_B
Even though OBJECT_B was first to the party with the D90 , OBJECT_A has effectively staked out DSLR video as its private fiefdom, delivering camera after camera with superior video prowess, carving out a new market-not unexpected, since OBJECT_A makes video cameras, and OBJECT_B, well, hasn't.;A_GREATER_B
The facts are that the D600 has been crippled as a serious video tool, and in that respect falls far behind the OBJECT_A lineup, which is a huge pity because I was looking forward to putting my OBJECT_B glass on it and not having to buy a OBJECT_A camera (I don't like them as stills cameras).;A_GREATER_B
And I have to agree with most of what you are saying - I don't have a 5d3 for AF speed comparison - but for skin tones the OBJECT_A is a lot better for me than the OBJECT_B (I owned the D700 most recently but also shot with the D300 for a couple of years and have worked with the D3x at times).;A_GREATER_B
Assuming the noise is evenly distributed, or if you have a debanding NR tool, you might be able to gain another stop, and the gains might be a little better in terms of magnitude for a OBJECT_A...which starts out with more noise than a OBJECT_B w/ Exmor, but the OBJECT_B will still benefit from NR as well.;A_GREATER_B
pls OBJECT_B bring out a new pro camera for sports - tested the d3 against the mark IV - more pixels plus the crop means for pics shoot on the other side of the pitch: a much better quality for OBJECT_A .... a d3x as fast and as low noisy like the d3 would help all the sportsshooters ... its a world cup year!;A_GREATER_B
If there is some measurement DxO is using that shows xxx lens on a D800 allows it to rate higher then they need to show that test/score - because of the scores they 'do' provide clearly show the OBJECT_A performing better... Just more OBJECT_B stroking by DxO, nothing more than 'under the table compensation'...;A_GREATER_B
TLJester said:   First - thanks for the great responses !!! ... and so far no OBJECT_B/OBJECT_A fist-fights have broken out I am tempted by the OBJECT_A as its newer, and the shots i have seen seem a bit punchier (and this is a pretty good deal!) on the other hand, i hear that the OBJECT_B is better with low (higher?);A_GREATER_B
I'm a professional photographer and use OBJECT_A gear - partly because I had 2 OBJECT_Bs (back in film days) and parts fell off those cameras so when it came time to 'go digital' I had the opportunity to try OBJECT_A -and I've had only one issue and OBJECT_A fixed it free even after the warranty expired, yet there are millions of happy OBJECT_B users out there.;A_GREATER_B

"The only things OBJECT_B have going for it are a comprehensive library, ""better than OBJECT_A"" performance, and mindshare.";A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_A has better support for such declarative styles and I am glad the core OBJECT_B language is not going down that route.;A_GREATER_B
I learned OBJECT_B first, and then came to OBJECT_A because of Rails, but I now prefer OBJECT_A over OBJECT_B irrespective of Rails.;A_GREATER_B
Perl is the imagination made power (and pay my bills!) and OBJECT_A because it's much more elegant and consistent than OBJECT_B.;A_GREATER_B
a sequence reserve can be simply: s.reverse etc. if you use databases: OBJECT_A database binding API is arguably better than OBJECT_B.;A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_A is definitely better than OBJECT_B, but still not perfect, and still an order of magnitude slower than statically typed languages.;A_GREATER_B
So OBJECT_A-like syntax is a pure win over OBJECT_B-like syntax - better for one-block functions, and equally ugly for no-block and multiple-block functions.;A_GREATER_B
Arguments please, the only OO-related thing that I saw could be considered superior in OBJECT_A 1.8 (compared to OBJECT_B 2.4) is the handling of properties...;A_GREATER_B
I also think OBJECT_B is a good choice because it is similarly very easy, but I think its much less fun because it lacks the beautiful synchronicity of OBJECT_A.;A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_A teaches you to use lambdas right out of the box while in OBJECT_B they're considered advanced play because of the awful (magical) syntax for creating them.;A_GREATER_B
One of them ( Jan rather than Andrzej ) was of the opinion that OBJECT_A was more object oriented than OBJECT_B because you are able tack methods onto the built-in classes.;A_GREATER_B
Of the two, OBJECT_A has always seemed the more interesting one (partly because it embraces functional programming more than OBJECT_B does), but I haven't yet had occasion to use it.;A_GREATER_B
"(One reason why I moved from OBJECT_B to OBJECT_A for scripting was because the #OBJECT_B IRC channel was condescending and rude to people asking questions; #OBJECT_A denizens were friendly.";A_GREATER_B
OBJECT_A has similar issues and although I do like OBJECT_A much better than I like OBJECT_B, I get the impression that Rails is roughly in the same boat at Django when it comes to managing/supporting the app.;A_GREATER_B
I'd come to the conclusion OBJECT_A was 'better' than most(certainly php, probably OBJECT_B, and javascript because is not well supported server-side), but i could not have said why as succinctly as you have.;A_GREATER_B
They also make the same lenses in OBJECT_B mount versions... Do they work better for OBJECT_A versus the ones that work on OBJECT_B bodies?;A_GREATER_B
right before the table starts falling out for OBJECT_A DR (of course with OBJECT_B I'd had already traded away two stops, maybe OBJECT_A is better, I didn't lose two stops going ISO100 to ISO400 ).;A_GREATER_B
If the whole point of the appeal of Mac OBJECT_A is that Mac software is better than OBJECT_B software - or at least better in the eyes of one segment of the market - what possible good would it do Apple to help that software run on OBJECT_B, too?;A_GREATER_B
Every so often, some of our academic colleagues wax lyrical about OBJECT_A apps and their rich functionality and/or ease of use for areas of content creation in which we're interested - podcasting, audio/video/image editing and upload, recording, etc. It'll be interesting to see whether Macs offer better or easier solutions than OBJECT_B for some kinds of content creation.;A_GREATER_B
IMHO they do a better job with OBJECT_B than OBJECT_A.;A_LESSER_B
And, the OBJECT_B D800 IS MUCH BETTER than the OBJECT_A 5Dmark3.;A_LESSER_B
I choose OBJECT_B because I prefer it more than the OBJECT_A features.;A_LESSER_B
Now the truth is that the OBJECT_B D800 is better than the OBJECT_A 5Dmark3.;A_LESSER_B
Mythbusters - OBJECT_A 6D's AF is rebel-grade and certainly inferior to OBJECT_B D6x0;A_LESSER_B
I switched to OBJECT_B because I do not like at all the marketing strategy of OBJECT_A.;A_LESSER_B
In my opinion, OBJECT_B cameras are better than OBJECT_A dslr cameras except D40 and D60.;A_LESSER_B
So far, I'd say the OBJECT_B system worked better than the OBJECT_A AI Focus (I'm using 7D).;A_LESSER_B
Every time OBJECT_B out performs OBJECT_A, it makes me feel a little better about my decision.;A_LESSER_B
IMHO OBJECT_B lenses have always been better than OBJECT_A and good lenses are the bottom line.;A_LESSER_B
I love OBJECT_B because the system feels better to me, but OBJECT_A makes a great product also.;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_A is also getting better, but I would not say they are ahead of OBJECT_B in terms of QA.;A_LESSER_B
THE OBJECT_B D800 HAS ALREADY PROVED TO BE BETTER THAN OBJECT_A 5Dmk3 and even better than the Phase one.;A_LESSER_B
I choose the OBJECT_B because it came with two lens for the same price as the OBJECT_A with just one lens.;A_LESSER_B
Even though I have a OBJECT_A 20D and love it, from all the reviews I've read, the OBJECT_B D200 sounds better.;A_LESSER_B
After about 3 months of research, I chose the OBJECT_B over the OBJECT_A because the features are much more user-friendly.;A_LESSER_B
Every OBJECT_B body is already better than its OBJECT_A equivalent... where's the point in making a d900, d4 or whatever ?;A_LESSER_B
Every shot you take reflects the quality of the sensor, and - IMO - Sony/OBJECT_B sensors are superior to OBJECT_A sensors.;A_LESSER_B
I've tried the OBJECT_A 18-200 IS, And the OBJECT_B 18-200 VR Is a much better lens with better build quality, And faster AF!;A_LESSER_B
And for what it's worth I use OBJECT_B because OBJECT_A does not have a fast full frame camera or an affordable FF with pro AF.;A_LESSER_B
"That said, OBJECT_A does make good stuff; I find OBJECT_B to have the superior interface, making it easier to use all the features.";A_LESSER_B
Now, conceding that OBJECT_B offers the better wides, with that extra $2,700 I just saved in buying OBJECT_A, I could buy a OBJECT_B D700;A_LESSER_B
The aperture and shutter speed dials are usual OBJECT_B fare, and is so much better than the way either OBJECT_A or Sony implements it.;A_LESSER_B
They picked OBJECT_B over OBJECT_A (and other brands) mostly because they thought that OBJECT_B provided better value in terms of ergonomics, AF,...;A_LESSER_B
I would consider some other brands, the OBJECT_B/sony/olympus 16mp+ sensors do noticeably better that the OBJECT_A for high iso and dynamic range.;A_LESSER_B
I quickly found that the OBJECT_B fitted in my hand considerably better than the OBJECT_A (D50 vs 350D) so I went with OBJECT_B for that single reason.;A_LESSER_B
And even though I went with OBJECT_A, I do think that OBJECT_B makes better cameras (even with that said, I'm not switching camps any time soon though).;A_LESSER_B
To get a feel for just how much better the OBJECT_B is is than the competition, have a look at this shootout between the OBJECT_B D3300 and the OBJECT_A SL1 .;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_B is really a great system and about 25 yrs or so ago when it was the OBJECT_B or OBJECT_A option I saw OBJECT_B as a superior make vs OBJECT_A at that time.;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_B has better button layout and ability to easily change all camera settings is better then OBJECT_A...tho I do like the big scroll wheel on the OBJECT_A.;A_LESSER_B
And since Fuji cameras uses OBJECT_B's F-mount, it rocks because OBJECT_B users can buy both Fuji and OBJECT_B bodies, which does have a slight edge over OBJECT_A.;A_LESSER_B
That said now that OBJECT_A has come out with their new system I'm sure OBJECT_B will have a new AF system for the D5 that will be just as good if not better.;A_LESSER_B
Given that the OBJECT_B 50 and 85 are equal or better in many ways than the OBJECT_A equivalent at f/1.4, your comment only applies IF you're shooting at f/1.2.;A_LESSER_B
Now the better and more civilized discussions are on the OBJECT_B forum......they are the new innovators and do it for a better price like OBJECT_A of the past.;A_LESSER_B
Also if you look for top performer from all today's cameras it's a OBJECT_B D4 which is 1/3-1/2 Ev better than OBJECT_A 1D X which is the best OBJECT_A for high ISO.;A_LESSER_B
Perfect specs, OBJECT_A will really have to go at great lengths with the new 5D to top the D800, and I know that at least in the AF section OBJECT_B will be better.;A_LESSER_B
Frank C. : I dunno, I think the new OBJECT_B is gonna smack this camera... is OBJECT_A still using their own sensors with the inferior DR? Aren't OBJECT_A owners fed up by now?;A_LESSER_B
This is why I switched to OBJECT_B because OBJECT_A kept changing their lens mounts and I kept having to buy new lenses every time I wanted to upgrade to a new generation camera!;A_LESSER_B
I picked up the OBJECT_A.. put it down and tried the OBJECT_B.. picked up the OBJECT_A one more time simply because I couldn't believe the very cheap feel and then purchased the OBJECT_B.;A_LESSER_B
I am astonished that so many fellow OBJECT_A users rush to flog whoever mentions that OBJECT_B have been doing one single parameter of sensor design better than OBJECT_A for some years.;A_LESSER_B
I forgot to mention in my review that the OBJECT_B zoom ring feels pretty good, the focusing ring not so, too loose for my taste, better then the OBJECT_A but not as good as the Sigma.;A_LESSER_B
The OBJECT_A 5d3 has much lower specs than the OBJECT_B 610, and Sony a99, yet you degrade the Sony against it, even though its performance figures - your DxOMark figures, are superior.;A_LESSER_B
I also have a frind that shoots for a pro sports team and he just sold a couple hundred grand worth OBJECT_A gear to move to the OBJECT_B D3X for the sole purpose of better iso capabilities.;A_LESSER_B
I was torn between going OBJECT_A or OBJECT_B, but in the end chose OBJECT_B because that is what is use to shoot in 35mm film cameras, and I have a friend who is a true pro, and he shoot OBJECT_B.;A_LESSER_B
I'm starting to do 24x60 inch prints quite a bit more regularly solely because I like them, they sell, and I can do them with visibly better quality using OBJECT_B 800's than with my OBJECT_A gear.;A_LESSER_B
Paul Bohman - I'm glad that you pointed out that the OBJECT_A images don't support the kind of shadow detail that the OBJECT_B images do, because I've begun to rely on the high dynamic range of my OBJECT_Bs for a lot of my pictures.;A_LESSER_B
Then again, I switched from OBJECT_B to OBJECT_A because I didn't like the D200's (and to a lesser extent, the D2H's) image quality and low-light performance...they both produced images that looked just a little cheap compared to the 5D.;A_LESSER_B
OBJECT_A might regret introducing the EF-S concept only if/when they lose large numbers of 60D sales because consumers realize that can upgrade to a OBJECT_B D600 for about the same cost as upgrading to a 60D and they buy the OBJECT_B instead.;A_LESSER_B
"i've visited every camera store in boston (at least 6 of them) in the last couple months and EVERY one of them recommended OBJECT_B dslr's over OBJECT_A dslr's saying they were ""more reliable"", ""better picture quality"", and ""easier to use"".";A_LESSER_B
For moderate priced lenses, OBJECT_Bs are often a bit faster in the same length (because they're in fact shorter for the same FOV), so the available darkness factor levels out a bit, and you may be shooting a OBJECT_B at 800 against a OBJECT_A at 1600.;A_LESSER_B
i get that OBJECT_A looks at sale fogures thats why they keep selling lenses that are sub par to what OBJECT_B offers in the same price range so people in the end want something better and buy a L as far as im concerned thats all OBJECT_A thinks about.;A_LESSER_B
The sensors are up to OBJECT_B quality, some OBJECT_B use Sony sensors, but because of SLT technology the light hitting the senor is only 70% of the one gathered by the lens their high ISO is at par with OBJECT_A sensors that are lagging behind for years.;A_LESSER_B
"I used one a few days ago in Lijiang and it is a seriously nice camera... ergonomically it is outstanding -- far far far better than the latest OBJECT_A EOS-1D revision, which makes me glad to be a OBJECT_B user... even if they do tend to lag a year behind OBJECT_A ;)";A_LESSER_B
While I shoot more video than stills for my clients (about 55/45 video skew) I still need to be concerned with still image quality....and OBJECT_B is simply better than Sony, OBJECT_A or Panasonic for stills....especially shooting in RAW and where dynamic range is important.;A_LESSER_B
There is no harm in using FX lenses on DX bodies and if 18-200 DX and 70-300 VR can't satisfy you then good luck with the 100-400 :) ,grass always looks greener on the other side :) I've used both, in film ,it doesn't matter but OBJECT_B in digital is far better than OBJECT_A.;A_LESSER_B
"I hung in there with OBJECT_B(because of the Nikkor glass that I already owned and my OBJECT_B flash gear, which is light years ahead of OBJECT_A's), saying to myself: ""don't jump to OBJECT_A, the day is coming when OBJECT_B will make THE camera that you're waiting for.....and here it is!";A_LESSER_B
To be honest I simply envy people who already have good OBJECT_B lens and OBJECT_B FF, they now have opportunity to expand a set with a perfect studio camera, while OBJECT_A owners, like me, have an opportunity to have better or good AF while other parameters remain almost unchanged.;A_LESSER_B
"And, ok, maybe saying OBJECT_A is ""really bad"" was a little too much, but still, I don't understand why so many people buy OBJECT_A when OBJECT_B and Pentax are better, and Pentax camera's are much cheaper than OBJECT_A when we look at all the extra functions they contain compared to OBJECT_A.";A_LESSER_B
A lot? Well, realistically there's just the OBJECT_B d600/d610 which is of course the better overall camera, but OBJECT_A knows from experience that 100-200€ won't make people jump ship - and those who want a ff and don't care about af will pay some $$$ more than the 70d w/o a second thought.;A_LESSER_B
"Camera ..DSLR with video ...OBJECT_A 600D or 60D or OBJECT_B 5100 ..all are HD capable ..OBJECT_B focusing slightly is better if the subject is moving when you zoom ( but the lenses are more specific than the OBJECT_As ) ..all take mics..you'll need ""off camera"" mics as the noise of the built in ones is intrusive...";A_LESSER_B
"The battery life is on the OBJECT_B is better; especially if you record more video than the OBJECT_A - After 150 photos and a number of videos and time-lapse images in a day the battery is showing as having a third of its life left; I carry a spare for the OBJECT_A as taking video definitely dents the battery life.";A_LESSER_B

I don't want to indicate that whatever the majority says is always correct - the majority of people think any version of OBJECT_B is better than OBJECT_A or Linux.;A_LESSER_B
If this news sounds familiar, it's because last month, rival measurement firm NetMarketShare found that OBJECT_B 8 market share had cruised past OBJECT_A in August .;A_LESSER_B

I usually recommend OBJECT_B over OBJECT_A, as I prefer it, but in this case it may be better, due to everything inherently being an object.;A_LESSER_B
I love the language but I'm considering getting better at OBJECT_B just because OBJECT_A is so slow I feel bad using it for anything serious.;A_LESSER_B

This is BAD for everyone because I'm finding left and right that a great many people are doing this and once OBJECT_A has lost their base, which they will, OBJECT_B can leave prices just where they are..... Sony is going to have a rough time, not many have the pocket for a Med Format.;NO_COMP
Most open-source projects use Subversion as a repository because other larger projects, such as SourceForge, Apache, OBJECT_B, OBJECT_A and many others, use it as well.;NO_COMP
Vista did okay right away because the OBJECT_B/Microsoft fanatics bought it, just like the Mac OBJECT_A/Apple fanatics do with Mac OBJECT_A.;NO_COMP
The third-party lens manufactures Tamron and Sigma have never been generally considered the better quality choice, but more like the lower cost alternative to the OBJECT_B, OBJECT_A and yes to Sony.;NO_COMP
Apple customers pay this premium because they think the melding of great hardware with Apple's solid software (OBJECT_A and iLife) is worth it over a OBJECT_B-based machine.;NO_COMP
A OBJECT_B/OBJECT_A script might work better for this....;NO_COMP
Yes, the D70 viewfinder is a disappointment to OBJECT_B users that are used to OBJECT_B's film cameras, but that doesn't make the OBJECT_A viewfinders any better.;NO_COMP
Lisp, Scheme, OBJECT_B, OBJECT_A, and Smalltalk are all better than Java and .Net, and all lack those features you find so necessary.;NO_COMP
I'm gonna test one myself - maybe switch to OBJECT_A (OBJECT_B user here) if it's really something better than my OBJECT_B kit lens
Perhaps OBJECT_A or OBJECT_B would have been a better choice.;NO_COMP
Notice that in the previous chart OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B are not shown because they represent only 0.6% and 0.2% respectively.;NO_COMP
So, from technical standpoint, spending valuable time and resources on improving what OS movement has/had (OBJECT_B, Java, OBJECT_A) would be much better time spent than working on Mono from scratch, just to have it now legally avaiable just on one MS alternative platform/distro.;NO_COMP
In my opinion it's still better designed and more productive than OBJECT_B Vista, any Linux DE, or even Mac OBJECT_A.;NO_COMP
I?m hung up on the question of how any OS that lets you do everything OBJECT_B does could compete with the iPad, because the iPad?s appeal and success is largely forged by the advantages that come from not allowing you to do so many of the things Mac OBJECT_A can do.;NO_COMP
Those 50+ OBJECT_B-based video games won't go to waste because the new iMacs have Intel-based processors, allowing the intrepid user to run both Apple OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B XP, which we already have on the Dell.;NO_COMP
It's pretty popular in the scientific community simply because it combines the simplicity (and noobicity of the coders) of PHP, OBJECT_B or OBJECT_A with high-level mathematical constructs.;NO_COMP
Exactly if running OBJECT_A under OBJECT_A and then OBJECT_B software will allow for better security I can not guess.;NO_COMP
A further advantage of perl or OBJECT_B (or OBJECT_A) would be that these should all have libraries for interfacing with matlab, and much better data structures than bash for tables.;NO_COMP
Many many better cameras (not only OBJECT_A or OBJECT_B) out there for lot less.;NO_COMP
I've never mentioned RealPlayer here although it is a well-known freeware because of the numerous negative experiences I've had with it crashing and then being difficult to remove from a OBJECT_B system (never installed it on Mac OBJECT_A).;NO_COMP

For the sake of argument, let's substitute Perl with OBJECT_B (or Smalltalk, OBJECT_A, Lisp or C++), because even great Perl programmers tend to have strange ideas about object orientation.;NO_COMP
Yes, because the PowerPC simply can't execute x86 code, the binary formats for OBJECT_B and OBJECT_A are different even on the same architecture, and in the general case even the scripting architectures for the two operating systems are completely different.;NO_COMP
This 8GB drive gives you fast transfers and driverless support for OBJECT_B ME and better, Mac OBJECT_A, and Linux.;NO_COMP
"Also, it's moot for me as I'm not running OBJECT_B right now; I don't think similar functionality exists on OBJECT_A. Linux might be better, but unfortunately it's not an option as I then couldn't run OBJECT_A, at least not without dual-booting, and I've become too used to VMs to do that.]";NO_COMP
Imagine the OBJECT_A and OBJECT_B teams examining the original RX100: oh, we can do better by offering an accessory EVF.;NO_COMP
The only stumbling block is that £549 would also buy such newcomers a decent entry level DSLR, such as a OBJECT_B D5100 or OBJECT_A EOS 1100D , with standard 18-55mm zoom and arguably better image quality - that's if the GF3's much smaller form factor isn't the over-riding consideration.;NO_COMP
Having owned all of the OBJECT_B and OBJECT_A super-telly lenses, I would rate this a tie with the OBJECT_A 300mm IS II, and better than the rest.;NO_COMP
Some people will find OBJECT_A easier or better whilst there are people who prefer OBJECT_B 10.;NO_COMP

OBJECT_A with bad drivers will simply sucks, as OBJECT_B, maybe worse (you cannot write a good OBJECT_A drivers simply because you know how to write good OBJECT_B drivers, you need to learn, it's time consuming).;NO_COMP
We have recently made a number of extensions to the emulator, including loadable packet schedulers, support for better MAC layer modeling, the inclusion in PlanetLab, and development of Linux and OBJECT_B versions in addition to the native FreeBSD and Mac OBJECT_A ones.;NO_COMP
Version 1.0.1.634 of PhotoRescue , the powerful photo recovery application for OBJECT_B and Mac OBJECT_A, includes improved recovery routines, better thumbnail generation with some file formats and support for multiple languages (follow the free update here link to request the new version).;NO_COMP
The UI is plain and simple, probably because this is a multi-platform application (OBJECT_B, Linux, and Solaris in addition to Mac OBJECT_A) that shares a lot of code between the different flavors.;NO_COMP
( another OBJECT_A's kingdom at stake) If a low price OBJECT_B FF camera comes to stage completing that 36 mp sensor..., OBJECT_A must react, the sooner the better.;NO_COMP
All in all its a feature rich camera that is a bit on the expensive side with poor build quality, I think a OBJECT_B or OBJECT_A is better quality and value ...;NO_COMP

"no mention of OBJECT_B 7? which is of course the 2nd of version of Vista, the one that ""doesn't suck"" because it is an even more obvious knock-off of the OBJECT_A UI ... would have fit the theme of the article.";NO_COMP
I think JavaScript is no better than 10, OBJECT_B and OBJECT_A are together with Perl around 15, maybe OBJECT_A has the highest level of these languages (Comments?).;NO_COMP
My view is that you can't stick a single opinion over the whole of the 3rd market brand - some are going to be lesser than OBJECT_A/OBJECT_B/sony options some will be better and some will be unique lenses to the 3rd party company that the other brands don't make.;NO_COMP
