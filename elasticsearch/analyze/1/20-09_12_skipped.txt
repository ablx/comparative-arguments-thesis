25) Joe Carter - Better than the Baylor/Smith/Johnson trifecta, but still not top 15 material.
A flier because they were 5-11 last year and play in the same division as the Indianapolis Colts, Tennessee Titans and the better-than-you-think Houston Texans .
A Bird In The Hand Is Worth Two In The Bush: Having something that is certain is much better than taking a risk for more, because chances are you might lose everything.
Actually it also made me think of TROY -- this movie is better than Troy, although frankly I'd rather see TROY again, if just for the pretty pretty men - because of that whole mostly-male obsession with seeing your name get written down into history, sung about, glory, yadda yadda.
550 home runs is very rare, in fact only one person hit 550 for quite a long time and to turn Cobb who specialized in so many other things into being better than Foxx, Williams, Musial or Gehrig perhaps, well, I think we are a little polluted by the home run numbers from '94-'2004 or so.
1 - Big Blue Kitten, by Kitten's Joy Eclipse winner is back for yet another go 2 - The Pizza Man, by English Channel He's obviously better than he showed at GP 3 - Slumber, by Cacique Another old pro who looks like he'll be back 4 - Ironicus, by Distorted Humor Eager for this miler's return from injury

1. MERPS, the source books are great but the rules are rolemaster light and humans can be wizards 2. Deciphers much better than MERPS, actually seams alot like an expanded version of MERPS Quest (a much lighter MERPS game to hook kids) while humans can still be wizards the magic system is much more like tolkiens works than MERPS.
According to Drake, the software easily determines appropriate sample sizes for test panels to ensure results can be read with confidence; gauges the reliability of a test estimate by placing bounds around the test response rate; and determines if one test panel is significantly better than another with a certain level of confidence.
Above all, whether we do it through our own website or not, we should GET SOME VIRAL VIDEOS OUT THERE that will play and play on YouTube and other sites, that the general public will actually want to watch and to watch again and to share with their friends - and generally use the new media rather better than we have as a Guild so far.
1. "The Natural" (1984) -- No movie mythologizes baseball better than Barry Levinson's well-crafted fairy tale about destiny-annointed, highly moral ballplayer Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) whose story combines a superhero tale with Arthurian legend and, yes, even Homer's "The Odyssey," all set to Randy Newman's appropriately heroic score.
Accompaniments include meaty, crisp sweet potato fries ($4.95), or buttery roasted garlic mashed potatoes ($4.95), both better than either the overcooked baked stuffed potato ($4) delivered to our table, tasteless skillet potatoes ($5.25), or heavily breaded onion rings ($4.95), that we sent back because they arrived practically charred.

A decent team can find itself dragged down by a spate of terrible misfortune; the '04 Tigers were certainly not a great team, but they were a far sight better than the '03 Tigers while sharing many of the same players (and the '02 Tigers were a very bad team but still 12 wins above the '03 team, again with many of the same players in common).
A few weeks ago, I introduuced Matisse to MuuMuse, the up-and-coming dance floor vixen (and former member of sister act Brit & Alex) responsible for the summer smash, "Better Than Her."

5. James Brown G/T Troy - Quick footed, long armed, athletic but raw OT from troy who some think is better suited at G as a pro, which should intrigue Reese because he'll be able to stick em at T in a pinch, because of the exp and solid arm length and quick feet.. kinda a developmental guy, but i think he'd be worth the wait, as he has quite a few tools...
A chance to see the play, (different from the movie version), and a chance to see something better than fat people losing weight (Biggest Loser), loser people trying to mate (The Bachelor, or worse, Bachelorette), people who are neither Stars, nor Dancing, on Dancing with the Stars (and those that excel are not live but edited before airing, and on and on.)

After all we've been through, given the fact that nothing- nothing -of significance is better than it was, and given the sweeping, unchecked power of the Republican party to create this mess, it is absolutely fascinating to witness the inability of everyday Republicans to grasp that their leaders have betrayed them (and every American) and done so in an overt fashion.

"A bookish librarian encounters danger and intrigue when he sets out in search of a lost Renaissance masterpiece rumored to possess strange powers...While the post- Da Vinci CodeÂ  bookstore and/or library is bursting with novels about ancient secrets imbedded in renaissance art, this book is a few notches better than most, thanks to its crisp prose and drum-tight plotting.

1. it contains one of my favorite reggae riddims of all time (I am far from home so I can't give you the title right now - if I remember correctly it's the last track on the C-side - to my ears the instrumental sounds better than the vox mix) 2. I rather listen to the "Spider's Web" than to "The General" because I just love to hear these instrumentals without any vocals at all.

Acts of desperation BB10 is even doing better than the so called wp, Microsoft is busy advertising Nokia whatever's hardware with it has nothing to do with MS' wp, what if the share holder kick elop out which is just a matter of time and then Nokia comes to its senses and adopts Android and also release and Android phone with better camera than the so called luniatic sorry lumnia.

Actual melee combat comes with certain rules that is better not to ignore like getting your opponents to work to surround you since they will want to surround you anyway, dont let yourself drop on the ground because it means immediate crippling or death... Games that thought players as actors took up those rules as a framework to anchor their gameplay and in this regard, Ryse makes a poor job.
After about an inch of cabbage ribbons went in, Grandma would sprinkle the kosher salt over it all, in a proportion that her hands knew better than her head, and Mom or Uncle John would take up the "tamper"-a huge turned flat bottomed cudgel made of oak, once again by Grandpa-and beat the cabbage down, smashing it and releasing the juices, packing it tightly into the crock, forcing out the air.
Adam James has got a big wooden spoon out, stuck it into a bubbling pot of claret and blue ire, and stirred: "What a lot of Villa fans such as George Templeton don't understand is that most Liverpool fans a) have the utmost respect for Villa and always have done even though truthfully they aren't in the Champions League and b) didn't really want Liverpool to sign Barry because Alonso is better.
3. Dad during the tail-end of Sunday's Pats-Jets game, after watching an inept Chad Pennington fire bounce passes all over the Meadowlands, then hearing Dan Dierdorf call Pennington New York's QB of the future: "I wish the future started right now." EIGHT THINGS YOU LEARN WHEN YOU HAVE DIRECTV AND YOU SPEND YOUR SUNDAYS WATCHING SIX GAMES AT ONCE ... 1. Deuce McAllister is much better than you think.
4. The spirit of wisdom answered (5) thus: 'On account of the deceit and violence of the fiend of greediness (6) men utter more words as to the manliness of every one whose wealth and power are more, and recount his deeds and actions more fully; (7) but, in the eyes of the angels and archangels, a poor man who is innocent and wise is better and more precious than a king or opulent man who is ignorant.'
5 stars from me...but the only crow I have to pick on you with is the names...here is just a few other suggestions.... CURIOUS GEORGE-- why steriods shouldn't be used on chimpanzees.....TENTACLES--the green lantern with roman hands and russian fingers....HUMPTY-DUMPTY--the guardians did put him back together again, better than he was before, better, stronger, faster... LONG DUCK DONG--what's happening, hotstuff?
9 Â Â Â  After a couple of years where it felt like the benefit of the doubt was being extended on all sides, I have once again found myself a bit out of sync with the poetry scene this year, notwithstanding the intense pleasure and pride of having managed to get Better Than Language into the world, and actually sincerely liking very much all thirteen of the poets represented in that book (I mean them and their work !).
After his appearance on the show the first night, solemnly firing his trusted hypeman for being too blunted when they perform, ultimately not really worth the money, Slim Thug came back with an actual song-that is, it should be noted, better than a lot of music we hear-and video showing he's curbed his spendthrift ways (though they do have a nice closeup on his giant chain, now apparently a relic of woebegone times).

Aaron Blake pointed out in the Washington Post that Romney ran ahead of most of the Republican Senate candidates: He did better than Connie Mack in Florida, George Allen in Virginia, Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin, Denny Rehberg in Montana, Jeff Flake in Arizona, Pete Hoekstra in Michigan, Deb Fischer in Nebraska, Rick Berg in North Dakota, Josh Mandel in Ohio, and of course Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.
420 421 4. Conclusion 422 Neuroscience may well improve forensic science in the long run (Neufeld & Scheck, 2010) where it is better than the 423 available psychologic or psychiatric evidence, particularly in cases where legal questions directly pertain to neural 424 questions, such as whether a certain kind of brain damage occurred, for which neuroimaging methods have already been 425 used frequently in the past (Snead, 2007).
3 points: Eric Mack liked James Starks and Grant (good, so-so), disliked Ingram and Pierre Thomas (on the money), knew Ray Rice would light it up, missed on Mendenhall and Blount, hit on Best, thought the Chiefs backfield would be better than it was, overestimated Chris Johnson, undervalued Cedric Benson, wrongly joined the anti-Hightower chorus, hit a home run with Beanie Wells, and got it wrong with Jones and Knowshon Moreno.

about those born at "the dangerous intersection of poverty and race"); Tony Campolo reminding me again that our call is to a radical faith, and radical expression of it; Al Gore speaking on care for the earth - from a thoroughly Christian perspective (y'all it was SO freakin' good - even better than his film); and so many other compelling speakers and preachers (William Shaw, Charles Adams, Julie Pennington-Russell, Bill Clinton!).

[ 4 ] In reality, according to Kaletsky, China's GDP in 2005 was $2.3 trillion and in 2015 is $10.3 trillion, [ 4 ] [ 4 ] the renminbi stabilized in October, "capital flight" dwindled, and there are "better-than-expected reserve figures released by the People's Bank of China on October 7."

AeroCube-4C is a 1U CubeSat (10 x 10 x 10 cm in dimension) that contains various "first of a kind" mission technologies including solar panel wings that close and open to tune the ballistic coefficient and enable efficient formation flying; three-axis attitude control to better than 3 degrees absolute accuracy; a 0.3-square-meter deployable deorbit device; sub-miniature reaction wheels; and a launch environment data logger that records ascent accelerations, pressure, and temperature.
Adjmi (Stunning, The Evildoers) combines wit, historical facts and razor-sharp characters to create a really insightful look into these historic characters - and at a time when mobs of poor, unkempt Occupy Wall Street protesters focusing on the nation's wealthy and screaming "I'm the 99 percent" makes us realize that we have more in common with Revolutionary France than we might have realized (and again, seeing the show on the night of an historic presidential election was a treat better than cake.)
1) Outsourcing development in countries such as India, China or Eastern Europe lowers the cost of developing a technology significantly; 2) The United States has lost leadership in certain key technology area: for instance, in the mobile industry, it is better to get an early traction in Asia and Europe as traditional players in the US won't move fast enough; 3) The Internet has enabled the creation of truly global companies: if we take the example of Jaspersoft, an open source business intelligence.
